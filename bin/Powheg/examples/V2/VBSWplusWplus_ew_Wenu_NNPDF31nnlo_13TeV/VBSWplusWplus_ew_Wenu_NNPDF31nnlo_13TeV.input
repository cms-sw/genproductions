# options for the separation of R=R_s+R_f
# no options: old POWHEG default.
# Option used during W mass working group report:
# theta_damp 1      ! Use Rf = k.p/(k.p + pt^2) (look at Bornzerodamp.f for details)

# Option for alternative splitting R-> R_s + R_f
# These were studied to see the effect on the unphysical negative value of the a0
# angular correlation coefficients
# new_damp 1        ! R_s = max(0,min(1, R_app/R)), where R_app is the soft collinear approximation to R, R_app = R_soft + R_coll - R_soft_coll
# hnew_damp 0.5     ! if this flag appears together with new_damp 1, then R_app -> R_app * h^2 * m^2 / ( h^2 * m^2 + pt2 ), where
                    ! h is the value of hnew_damp, m is the mass of the vector boson, and pt2 is the square of its transverse momentum
# hdamp 1.0         ! if this flag appears, R_s -> R_s *  h^2 * m^2 / ( h^2 * m^2 + pt2 ), where h is the value of hdamp.
                    ! The following combination seem to yield a0 consistent with non-negative values:
                    ! new_damp 1 (alone); new_damp 1 + hdamp 0.5; new_damp 1 + hnew_damp 1 ; new_damp 1 + hnew_damp 0.5
                    ! Looking at the Bornzerodamp.f routine should clarify all doubts on these options.
                    ! You can experiment with other values. Remember: too small  hnew_damp and/or hdamp factors can cause troubles,
                    ! check that you get a nice sudakov shape of the vector boson pt.

                    ! Notice: you can specify either new_damp or theta_damp or nothing (to use
                    ! the Powheg default for damping Born zeros), but no more than one of the two.
