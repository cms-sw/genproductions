Description:
   STDHEP contains a set of translation routines which convert
   Herwig, Jetset, Isajet, or QQ events to and from the standard
   HEP event format.  STDHEP also contains utility routines
   to work with the HEPEVT common block and a set of I/O routines.
   The HEPEVT common block allows 4000 particles per event.

   This release of StdHep contains all necessary files to build the 
   StdHep and mcfio libraries.  You will need Isajet, Herwig, Pythia, 
   and/or QQ to build anything besides the "standalone" examples.
   
   StdHep C++ code is in CLHEP.

   StdHep uses include files from the event generators.
   These include files are subject to change.  Also, the generator
   particle numbering is subject to change.  Thus, we cannot
   guarantee that StdHep will work with releases of the generators
   other than those it was built with.

This release of StdHep was built with and contains headers from (see src/inc/*):
   Isajet v7_72a
   Herwig v6_510a
   Pythia v6_413
   QQ v9_2b

Usage:
   % setup stdhep
   See $STDHEP_DIR/example.

   gmake clean (to get rid of the old libraries)
   gmake all
   gmake DEBUG=-g all (to build debug libraries)
   optional:  gmake cleanobjs (to get rid of *.o files)
