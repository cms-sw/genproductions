# <PROCDIR>/FixedOrderAnalysis/analysis_*_template.f file for details
# on how to write your own analysis.

# Analysis format.
# Can either be 'topdrawer', 'root', 'HwU', 'LHE' or 'none'.
# When choosing HwU, it comes with a GnuPlot wrapper. When choosing
# topdrawer, the histogramming package 'dbook.f' is included in the
# code, while when choosing root the 'rbook_fe8.f' and 'rbook_be8.cc'
# are included. If 'none' is chosen, all the other entries below have
# to be set empty.

#
# Needed extra-libraries (FastJet is already linked):
FO_EXTRALIBS = 
#
# (Absolute) path to the extra libraries. Directory names should be
# separated by white spaces.
FO_EXTRAPATHS =
#
# (Absolute) path to the dirs containing header files needed by the
# libraries (e.g. C++ header files):
FO_INCLUDEPATHS =

# User's analysis (to be put in the <PROCDIR>/FixedOrderAnalysis/

## When linking with root, the following settings are a working
## example on lxplus (CERN) as of July 2014. When using this, comment
## out the lines above and replace <PATH_TO_ROOT> with the physical
## path to root,
## e.g. /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.34.11/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-dbg/root/
#FO_ANALYSIS_FORMAT = root
#FO_EXTRALIBS = Core Cint Hist Matrix MathCore RIO dl Thread
#FO_EXTRAPATHS = <PATH_TO_ROOT>/lib
#FO_INCLUDEPATHS = <PATH_TO_ROOT>/include
