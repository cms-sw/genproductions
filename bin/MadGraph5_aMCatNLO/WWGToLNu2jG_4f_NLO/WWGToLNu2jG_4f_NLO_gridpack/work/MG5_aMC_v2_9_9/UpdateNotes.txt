Update notes for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (in reverse time order)


2.9.9 (25/02/2022)
     OM: Fix a bug introduced in 2.9.0 for MLM generation in presence of mix EW/QCD process.
         The bug typically leads to a crash within the systematics.py due to wrong power of alpha_s
	 The bug might sometimes not lead to a crash but the impact is "limited" to a change in the (various)
	 scale choice associated to the events. Therefore this is likely to be within scale uncertainty. It can
	 impact the matching with the parton-shower (but this should be visible within the DJR validation plot). 
     OM: Fix some wrong zero-result that occur in presence of conflincting breit-wigner.
     OM: Fix an issue when using "$ X" when X~ can be onshell, the phase-space symmetry factor was wrongly set.

2.9.8 (21/02/2022)
     OM: Fix in madspin where onlyhelicity mode was not working anymore
         also allows to not specify any decay in that mode.
     OM: Fix in multi_run mode where some meta-data where incorrectly set within the merged lhef file.
         This occurs ONLY in presence of non positive definite cross-section. 
         Only normalization of the cross-section/weight/statistical error could be wrong. Shape are not impacted.

2.9.7 (29/11/21)
     OM: Fix the behavior of python seed for madevent/madwidth/mcatnlo/madspin
         Now the first of those to setup a python seed will forbid any future reset of the seed
	 Frequent reset of the seed when moving to one package to the next was creating
	 a bias in the effective branching ratio out of madspin (observed only of NLO sample)
	 see: https://bugs.launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo/+bug/1951120
	 Thanks Hannes for the information.
     RF+PT+SF: Fixed a 10-year-old bug that was there in the importance sampling over the FKS configurations.
	 - Fix to pick one shower scale for the S event at random among the FKS configurations,
	   instead of taking the weighted average.
	 - removed the n-body contributions from the random picking of the showerscale among FKS configurations.
        Those bugs were leading at an incorect pick of the shower scale. The observed impact is relatively small
	and occur in the matching region.

2.9.6 (02/11/21)
     OM: Forbid the possibity to ask for massless boson to be longitudinally polarised.
         Asking for those with large multi-particle label could have hide the fact that the code
	 was returning a non zero cross-section for such request.
     OM: for process like p p > w+{X} w+{Y}, w+ > l+ vl
         i.e. process with polarization of  identical particle where the decay involves multi-particles and 
         where the lepton does not all have the same mass, some of the process were incorrectly discarded.
     OM: fix an issue for photon initial state with lpp=+-4 where the lhef output was not setting the muon
         as the correct colliding particles (thanks to Yuunjia Bao) 	  
     OM: Fixing an issue that madspin was not always using the python executable that was used by the
         mg5_aMC executable
     OM+PT: Change the shower script running pythia8 in order to be working with pythia8.3.
         Running with Pythia8.2 (or lower) is then not possible anymore.
     OM: Fix issue that some loop-induced processes were not working anymore since 2.9.0
     OM: Fix the default set of cut present in the default run_card if gluon were present in the final state but no
         light (or b) quark. The absence of those cuts, in that situation, were leading to hardcoded cut that was
	 not easy to overwrite by non expert user.
	 
2.9.5 (22/08/21)
      OM+LM: [LO only] Fix the factorization scale dependence for lpp=2/3/4.
             This was claimed to be using fixed scale computation while in
	     some case the scale was dynamical
             To have full flexibility we introduced two additional (hidden)
	     parameter
             fixed_fac_scale1 and fixed_fac_scale2 that allow to choose
	     fixed scale for only one beam.
      OM: fix auto-width that was not following	run_mode specification
      OM: fixing missing rwgt_info for reweighting with gridpack mode
      OM: fixing 'check' command with the skip_event mode
      OM: fixing auto-width computation for 3 body decay and identical particle which was sometimes leading to crash
      OM: Fix some potential infinite loop when running with python3
      
2.9.4(30/05/21)
      OM: Fix a python3 issue for madSpin when using in a gridpack mode (set ms_dir)
      OM: Fix an issue for non positive definite matrix-element when using the
          "set group_subprocesses False"  mode of MG5aMc
      OM: Fix a speed issue for gridpack in readonly mode where the grid were recomputed 

2.9.3(25/03/21)
      OM: Fix an issue with t-channel particles for massive initial state where sqrt(S)
          was close to the mass of the initial mass. boundary condition on t-channnel were
	  incorrectly setup leading to strange spectrum in various distribution (very old bug)
      OM: Fix an issue with a crash for loop computation
      OM: more python3 fixing bug
      OM: Fix a bug in the re-writting of the run_card when seed was specify leading to a wrong templating
      OM: various small fix of crash/better logging/debug information
     
2.9.2(14/02/21)
      MZ+RF+OM: Fix relevant to the case when PDG specific cuts are set in the NLO run_card.
        The generation of tau was not taking into account the information.
      OM: fix an issue when running with python3 where the normalization of pythia8 file were wrong
          when pythia8 was run in parralel.
      OM: Fix some wrong scale variation at NLO+PS (introduced in 2.9.0)
      OM: Fix loop-induced which was not working anymore
      OM: Fix an issue with the installation of pythia-pgs
      

2.9.1.2 (02/02/21)
      Kiran+OM: Fixing issue for the MSSM model
      OM: Fixing issue with mac support
      OM: fix a bug introduced within 2.8.2 related to a wrong phase-space mapping of conflicting resonances.
          Leading to zero cross-section and/or potential bias cross-section for more complex cases.
	  The issue occurs only if you have a conflicting resonances followed by a massless propopagator.
	  one example is generate p p > z h , z > e+ e-, h > b b~ a

2.9.0 (30/01/21)    **** Major speed-up update for LO computation ***
      Kiran+OM: Optimization of the matrix-element at run-time using recycling helicity method
                - This fasten LO computation by a factor around 2
		- This can be turned off via the command "output PATH --hel_recycling=False"
      OM: Various optimization fot T-channel integration
          - use different ordering for T-channel. Four different ordering have been implemented
	    at generation time, the code decides which ordering to use channel-per-channel.
	    This can be turned off via the command "output PATH --t_strategy=2"
	  - increase number of maximum iteration for double or more T-channel
	  - implement an alternative to the standard multi-channel.
	     instead of using the amplitude square it use the product of the denominator
	     (the default strategy use depends of the process)
	  - speed-up for VBF type of process  are often around 100 times faster
	  - This fixes a lot of issue for processes failing to generate the targetted number of events.
      OM: Better version of the color-computation (but this leads to only modest gain but for very complex processes.)
          This optimizations leads to a longer generation time of the code (only for complex processes).
	  This can be turned off  via "output PATH --jamp_optim=False"
      OM: New parameter in the run_card:
          - sde_strategy: allows to change the default multi-channel strategy
	  - a new phase-space optimization parameter are now easily availabe via the command "update ps_optim" 
      OM: New global parameter "auto_convert_model"
          if set on True (set auto_convert_model T or via input/mg5_configuration.txt)
	  all model crashing due to a python3 compatibility issue of the UFO model will be automatically converted
	  to a python3 compatible model. 

2.8.3 (26/01/21):
      OM: Buch of bunch fixing related to python3 issue (mainly related to unicode encoding)
      OM: Various fix for reweighting with loop (mainly with python3 as well)
      OM: Fix a potential bug for polarized sample with at least three polarised particles with a least two
          identical particles and one different polarised particle.
      OM: Fix various bug for maddm interface (thanks Daniele)
      OM: Fix various issue with overall order usage
      OM: Fix compatibility with MacOS 11
      OM: fix additional GCC10 compatibility issue
      OM: fix issue for 1>n process where width were set to zero automatically (introduced in 2.8.0)
      OM: fix aloha output mode for python output
      OM: avoid a bug with helicity filtering that was kept for all benchmark when using
          multiple successive re-weighting
      OM: Edition of the reweighting card via "set" command is not starting from the original param_card
          used to generated the events file and not from the model default anymore.
      OM: Interference have now their default dynamical scale set to HT/2


2.8.2 (30/10/20):
      OM: Fix a bug when setting width to zero where they were actually set to 1e-6 times the width
          This can lead to bias in the cross-section if your process is very sensitive to the cross-section
	  due to gauge cancelation. Bug introduced in version 2.6.4.
      OM: Hide Block parameter loop from NLO model but for madloop run.
          The factorization scale is still determine by the setup of the run_card as before
      OM: Fix couple of python3 specific bug

2.8.1(24/09/20):
      OM: Change user interface related to FxFx mode
          - If you have multiple multiplicities at NLO,
	    - the default run_card is modified accordingly
	        - has icckw=3 and follow the official FxFx recomendation (i.e. for
		  scale and jet algo)
            - the shower card has two parameter that are dynamically set 
                - njmax (default: -1) is automatically set depending of the process definition
                - Qcut (default: -1) is now automatically set to twice ptj parameter
            - the default parton-shower is automatically set to Pythia8
          - The value of the cross-section after FxFx formalism (removing double counting) is
	    now printed on the log and available on the HTML page
      OM: Fix for the auto width for three body decay in presence of identical particles.
      OM: add support for __header__ in UFO model
      OM: allow restriction card to have auto-width
      OM: fixing some html link (removed ajax link forbidden by major web browser)
      OM: Various fix related to the python3 support
          - including more efficient model conversion method

2.8.0 (21/08/20):
      OM: pass to python3 by default
      OM: For LO process, you can now set lpp1 and lpp2 to "4" for process with initial photon in order to get the
          effective photon approximation. This mode behaves like the "3" one: The cut-off scale of the approximation
	  is taken from the fixed renormalization factorisation scale: "dsqrt_q2fact1/dsqrt_q2fact2"
      OM: The width ao T-channel propagator are now set to zero automatically.
          To return to the previous behaviour , you can use the options "set zerowidth_tchannel False"
	  (to set before the output command)
      OM: Change in madevent phase-space integrator for T-channel:
            - The integration of photon/Z/Higgs are now done together rather than separatly and follow importance
	       sampling of the photon channel
	    - A new option "set max_t_for_channel X" allows to veto some channel of integration with more than X
	       t-channel propagator. This options can speed-up significantly the computation in VBF process.
	       (We advise to set X to 2 in those cases)
	    - Fix a numerical issue occuring for low invariant mass in T-channel creating spurious configuration.   
      OM: In madspin_card you can now replace the line "launch"
          by "launch -n NAME", this will allow to specify the name of the
	  directory in EVENTS where that run is stored.
      OM: Change in the python interface of the standalone output. In top of the pdg of the particles,
          you can now use the process_id (the one specified with @X) to distinguish process with the same particle
	  content. This parameter can be set to -1 and the function then ignore that parameter.
      OM: Adding new option in reweighting to allow the user to use the process_id in presence of ambiguous
          initial/final state.
      OM: Update the makefile of standalone interface to python to be able to compile in multicore.
           (thanks Matthias Komm)
      OM: Update of the auto-width code to support UFO form-factors
      OM: Fixing numerical issue  with the boost in EPA mode.

      ALL: Contains all feature of 2.7.0			
      OM: Support for python3.7 in top of python 2.7
          - python2.6  is not supported anymore
	  - this requires the module "six" [pip install six --user]
      OM: dropping function set low_mem_multicore_nlo
      OM: dropping support for syscalc (c++ version)
      OM: introduction of new setup variable
          - f2py_compiler_py2 and f2py_compiler_py3
	    which will be used to overwrite f2py_compiler when using the associate python version
          - lhapdf_py2 and lhapdf_py3
	    same for lhapdf
      OM: introduction of a new command "convert model FULLPATH"
          - try to convert a UFO model compatible to python2 only to a new model compatible both with
	    Python2 and Python3 (no guarantee)


                             ** Main Branch  Update **
			
2.7.3(21/06/20)
      OM: Fixing some bug for read-only LO gridpacks (wrong cross-section and shape when generating events).
          Thanks to Congqiao Li for this
      OM: Allowing loop-induced process to run on LO gridpack with read-only mode.
          Thanks to Congqiao Li for this      
      OM: Fix a bug in the longitudinal polarization for off-shell effect, leading to deviation at large invariant mass.
      OM: Adding more option to the run_card for fine tuning phase-space integration steps
          All are hidden by default:
	    - hard_survey [default=1]: request for more points in survey (and subsequent refine)
	    - second_refine_treshold [default=1.5]: forbid second refine if cross section after first refine is
	       is smaller than cross-section of the survey times such treshold
      OM: new command for the editions of the cards:
           - set nodecay: remove all decay line from the madspin_card
	   - set BLOCKNAME all VALUE: set all entry of the param_card "BLOCKNAME" to VALUE
	   - edit CARDNAME --comment_line='<regular_expression>' : new syntax to comment all lines of a card
	       that are matching a given regular expression
      OM: For Mac only, when running in script mode, MG5aMC will now prevent the computer to go to idle sleep.
          You can prevent this by running with the '-s' option. like ./bin/mg5_aMC -s PATH_TO_CMD

2.7.2(17/03/20)
      OM: Fix a Bug in pythia8 running on Ubuntu 18.04.4 machine
      OM: Speed up standalone_cpp code by changing compilation flag

2.7.1(09/03/20)
      OM: Fixing issue (wrong cross-section and differential cross-section) for
          polarised sample when
	   1) you have identical polarised particles
	   2) those particles are decays
	  examples: p p > j j w+{0} w+{T}, w+ > e+ e-
      OM: In presence of identical particles, if you define the exact number of decays
          (either via the decay chain syntax or via MadSpin) then they are assigned in an ordered way:
          generate p p > z{0} z{T}, z > l+ l-, z > j j
	  means that the Longitudinal Z decays to lepton (transverse to jet)
	  Thanks to Jie Xiao for reporting such issues. 
      OM: Effective Photon approximation is now always done with a fix cutoff. This use the FIXED factorization scale
          of the associate beam as the cutoff of the Improved Weizsaecker-Williams.
      OM: Allow to install lhapdf6.2 by default
      OM: Fixing website used to download pdf since lhapdf removed their previous hepforge page for pdf set.
      OM: Fixed a bug (leading to a crash) introduced in 2.6.6 related to the ckkw/MLM check for BSM model
          with gluon with non QCD interaction
      OM: For fortran standalone with python binding, this is not necessary anymore to run the code from a specific directory.
          You need however need to use the standard path for the param_card or have the file ident_card within the same
	  directory as the param_card.dat.


2.7.0(20/01/20)
      OM: Allow for a new syntax in presence of multi-jet/lepton process:
         generate p p > 3j replaces p p > j j j 
      OM: Allow syntax for (fully) polarized particles at LO: [1912.01725]
           ex: p p > w+{0} j, e+{L} e-{R} > mu+ mu- Z{T}
               p p > w+{T} w-{0} j j, w+ > e+ ve, w- > j j
      OM: (Thanks to K. Mawatari, K. Hagiwara) implemention of the axial gauge for the photon/gluon propagator.
          via "set gauge axial"
      OM: Support for elastic photon from heavy ion implemented. For PA collision, you have to generate your diagram
          with "set group_subprocesses False"
      OM: The default run_card.dat is now by default even more specific to your process. 
          Nearly all the cuts are now hidden by default if they do not impact your current process.
          This allows to have less information by default in the run_card which should simplifies its 
          readibility. 
      OM: distinguish in the code if zero contribution are related to no point passing cuts or if
          they are related to vanishing matrix-element. In the later case, allow for a lower threshold.
          (This allow to fasten the computation of such zero contribution)


2.6.7(16/10/19)
      OM: Fix a bug introduced in 2.6.2, some processes with gluon like particles which can lead to the wrong sign for interference term. 
      OM: Fix a bug introduced in 2.6.6 related to the restriction of model which was leading to wrong result for re-weighitng with loop model (but impact can in principle be not limited to re-weighting).
      OM: systematics now supports the option --weight_format and --weight_info (see help command for details)
      OM: set the auto_ptj_mjj variable to True by default
      OM: the systematics_arguments default value is modified in presence of matching/merging.
      OM: reweight: add an option --rwgt_info to allow to customise the banner information associate to that weight
      RF: Fixed a bug in the warning when using FxFx in conjunction with Herwig++/Herwig7. Also, with latest version of
          Herwig7.1.x, the FxFx needed files are compiled by default with in the Herwig code. Thanks Andreas Papaefstathiou.

2.6.6(28/07/19)
      OM: Bug in the edition of the shower_card. The set command of logical parameter was never setting the 
          parameter to False. (Thanks to Richard Ruiz) 
      RF: Fixed a bug in the creation of the energy-stripped i_FKS momentum. Tested for several processes,
          and seems to have been completely harmless.
      OM: Forbidding the use of CKKW/default scale for some UFO model allowing gluon emission from quark with
          no dependence in aS
      OM: Add an option "keep_ordering" for reweighting feature to allow to sometimes use decay chain even if
          you have ambiguity between final state particles.
      OM: Fixed an issue with interference which sometimes happens when some polarization contribution were negative but not all of them.
      VH: Change in the pythia8 output mode (thanks to Peter Skands)
      OM: Any number in the cards (not only integer) can use multiplication, division and k/M suffix for times 1000 and 1 million respectively
      OM: Energy cut (at LO) are now hidden by default for LHC type of run but visible for lepton collider ones.
      OM: Same for beam polarization

2.6.5 (03/02/19)
      OM: Fix some speed issue with the generated gridpack --speed issue introduced in 2.6.1--
      OM: Fix a bug in the computation of systematics when running with Python 2.6.
      OM: import model PATH, where PATH does not exists yet, will now connect to the online db
          if the model_name is present in the online db, then the model will be installed in the specified path.
      MZ: Applgrid+aMCFast was broken for some processes (since 2.6.0), due to wrong 
          information written into initial_states_map.dat. This has been fixed now
      OM: change in the gridpack. It automatically runs the systematics.py (if configure in the run_card)
      OM: Fix  a MLM crash occuring for p p > go go (0,1,2 j)
      OM: Fix issue for BSM model with additional colored particle where the default dynamical scale choice 
          was crashing


2.6.4 (09/11/18)
      OM: add specific treatement for small width (at LO only and not for loop-induced)
          if the width is smaller than 1e-6 times the mass, a fake width (at that value) is used for the
          numerical evaluation of the matrix-element. S-channel resonances are re-scaled according to 
          narrow-width approximation to return the correct total cross-section (the distribution of events 
          will on the other hand follow the new width). 
          The parameter '1e-6' can be changed by adding to (LO) run_card the parameter: "small_width_treatment"
      OM: add a new command "install looptools" to trigger the question that is automatically trigger 
          the first time a loop computation is needed.
      RF: Fixed a bug when using TopDrawer plots for f(N)LO runs, where the combination of the plots could lead
          to completely wrong histograms/distributions in case of high-precision runs.
      OM: Fix some MLM crash for some processes (in particular BSM processes with W'). 
      OM: Fix a bug in the reweighting due to the new lhe format (the one avoiding some issue with py8)
      OM: Fix a behavior for negative mass, the width was set to negative in the param_card automatically
          making the Parton-shower (and other code) to crash since this does not follow the convention.
      OM: Change compiler flag to support Mojave.

2.6.3.2 (22/06/18)
      OM: Fix a bug in auto-width when mass are below QCD scale.
      OM: Fix a bug for g b initial state where the mass in the lhe file was not always correctly assigned
          Note that the momentum was fine (i.e. in the file P^2 was not equal to the mention M but to the correct one)
      OM: Improvment for madspin in the mode spinmode=none
      OM: Fix a bug in MadSpin which was making MadSpin to work only in debug mode

2.6.3 (15/06/18)
      OM: When importing model, we now run one additional layer of optimisation:
           - if a vertex as two identical coupling for the same color structure then the associated lorentz 
             structure are merged in a single one and the vertex is modified accordingly
      OM: When restricting a model, we also run one additional layer of optimisation
           - Opposite sign coupling are now identified and merged into a single one
           - if a vertex as two identical coupling (up to the sign) for the same color structure
             then the associated lorentz structure are merged in a single one and the 
             vertex is modified accordingly 
      VH+OM: changing the ALOHA naming scheme for combine routine when the function name starts to be too long. 
      OM: adding a hidden parameter to the run_card (python_seed) to allow to control the randon number 
          generated within python and be able to have full reproducibility of the events
      OM: Fixing some issue with the default dynamical scale choice for 
            - non minimal QED sample
            - heft model when multiple radiation coming from the higgs decay/scattering
          This can also impact MLM since it use the same definition for the dynamical scale
      OM: Fix some issue for DIS scattering where the shat was wrongly defined for low energy scattering.
          Low energy scattering are not adviced since they break the factorization theorem.
          In particular the z-boost of the events are quite ill defined in that scenario.
      OM: changing the format of the param_card for NLO model to match expectation from the latest PY8
      OM: Update of MadSpin to allow special input file for the case of spinmode=none. 
          With that very simple mode of decay, you can now decay hepmc file or wrongly formatted leshouches event
          (in that mode we do not have spin correlation and width effect)
      PT: in montecarlocounter.f: improved colour-flow treatment in the case gluons are twice colour-connected to each other
          new gfunction(w) to get smoothly to 0 as w -> 1. (for NLO+PS run)
      OM: Fix some issue for the new QED model (including one in the handling of complex mass scheme of such model)
      OM: Fixing an issue of the param_card out of sync when running compute-widths
      OM: Adding Qnumbers block for ghost (the latest version of py8 was crashing due to their absence)

2.6.2 (29/04/18)

      Heavy ion pdf / pdf in general:
      -------------------------------
      OM: Support for rescaling PDF to ion PDF (assuming independent hadron), this is well suited for Lead-Lead collision, p-Lead collision and fix-target
      OM: Support in systematics.py for ion pdf. Possiblity to rescale only one beam (usefull to change only on PDF for fix target experiment)
      OM: Removing internal support for old type of PDF (only supported internal pdf are now cteq6 and nnpdf23)


      User Interface
      --------------
      OM: introduce "update to_full" command to display all the hidden parameter.
      OM: introduce "update ion_pdf" and "update beam_pol" to add related section in the run_card.
          the polarization of the beam is set as hidden parameter instead as default parameter
      OM: improve handling of (some) run_card parameter:
            - add comment that can be displayed via "help NAME"
            - add autocompletion for some parameter
            - add direct rejection of parameter edition if not in some allowed list/range
      
      Bug fixes:
      ----------
      OM: Fix issue with madspin introduced in 2.6.1 (failing to generate correct diagram for NLO process)
      OM: fix crash in 1>N reweighting
      RF+MZ: Fixed a problem with (f)NLO(+PS) runs in case the Born has identical QCD-charged
      	     particles. Cross sections were typically correct, but some distributions might
	     have shown an asymmetry. 
      OM: Change in LO maching for HEFT (or any model with hgg vertex) in the way to flag jet that should
          not take part in the matching/merging procedure.
      OM: Fixed a bug for loop induced in gridpack mode
      RF: Fixed a bug for ApplGrid: in rare cases the ApplGrid tables were filled twice for the same event
      OM: Fixed a bug for fixed target experiment when the energy of the beam was set to 0. 
      RF: Fixed an issue where too many files were opened for fNLO runs in rare cases
      OM: Fix issue on Madevent html output where some link where broken
      OM: Fix issue for the display lorentz function (was also presenting security issue for online use)

      Enhancement:
      -----------
      OM: add the value of all the widths in Auto-width in the scan summary file
      OM: For 1>N, if the user set fixed_run_scale to True, then the scale is choose accordingly
          and not following the mass of the inital state anymore
      RF: For the HwU histograms, if no gnuplot installation is found, write the gnuplot scripts in v5
          format (instead of the very old v4 format).
      OM: Change the default LO output directory structure. Now by default the lepton and neutrino are split 
          in two different directory. This avoids to face problem with the assymetric cut on lepton/neutrino
      OM: loop-filter commands are now working for loop-induced processes
      OM: New  method avoiding that two process are running inside the same output directory.
          This is implemented only for Gridpack and LO run so far. 
          The new method should be more robust in case of crash (i.e. not wrongly trigger as before)
      OM: For LO scan, if a crash (or ctrl-c) occurs during the scan, the original param_card is now
          restored.

2.6.1 (12/12/17)

      RF+MZ: It is now possible to add LO matrix elements (with [LOonly]) 
             to Fx-Fx merged samples. Thanks to Josh Bendavid for testing.
      OM: Re-factoring the code asking which program to use (both at LO and NLO)
          - design modular, designed for PLUGIN interactions
          - the length of the question auto adapts to the size of the shell
      OM: Allowing to have the gridpack stored on a readonly filesystem
      OM: Fix a bug in matching/merging forbiding the pdf reweighting for some processes (since 2.4.0)
      OM: Creation of online database with the name of known UFO model. If a use try to import a model
          which does not exits locally, the code will automatically check that database and download the 
          associate model if it exists. You can contact us if you are the author of one model which is not
          on our database. 
	  The list of all available model is available by typing "display model_list"
      OM: Model with __arxiv__ attribute will display "please cite XXXX.XXXXX when using this model" when
          loaded for the first time.
      OM: A fail of importing a UFO model does not try anymore to import v4 model
      OM: Many model present in models directory have been removed, however they can still be imported
          since they are available via automatic-download
      OM: Refactoring of the gridpack functionality with an infinite loop to reach the requested number of events
      OM+RF: Adding new class of cut at LO/NLO defined via the pdg of the particle
      VH: Support for the latest version of MA5

      New Functionalities:
      --------------------
      RF+OM: Added the possibility to also have a bias-function for event generation at (f)NLO(+PS)
      OM: Improve Re-WEIGHTING module
          1) creation of a single library by hyppothesis. 
          2) library for new hyppothesis can be specify via the new
             options: change tree_path and change virt_path
          3) allows to re-weight with different mass in the final states (LO only)
             This forces to rewrite a new lhe file, not adding weight inside the file
             (via the command: change output 2.0)
          4) allows to run the systematics on the newly generated file (for new output file)
             (via the command change systematics True)
          5) Fix some Nan issue for NLO reweighting in presence of colinear emission
	  6) various bug fixing, speed improvement,...
      OM: Add new option to SYSTEMATICS program:
           --remove_weights, --keep_weights, --start_id
           See "help systematics for more details."
      OM: Allow to specify param_card, run_card,... directly via an html link.

      Bug Fixing:
      -----------
      OM: Update condor class to support CERN type of cluster (thanks Daria Satco)
      OM: Fixing a bug leading to a crash in pythia8 due to one event wrongly written when splitting the
          events for the parralelization of pythia8

      OM: Fix a bug in gripack@NLO which forbids to run it when the gridpack was generated with 0 events.
      RF: Fixed bug #1694548 (problem with NLO for QCD-charged heavy vector bosons).
      RF: Another fix (adding on a fix in 2.5.5) related to FxFx merging in case there are
      RF: Fixed bug #1706072 related to wrong path with NLO gridpack mode
          diagrams with 1->3 decays.
      RF: Fixed a bug (found by SF) that gave a seriously biased resonance mass when using MadSpin for decaying a 2->1 process.
      PT: Fix in montecarlocounter.f. Previously, for NLO+PS it was reading some subleading-colour information, now all
          information passed to the MC counterterms is correctly leading colour. 
      OM: Fix systematics computation for lepton collider
      OM+VH: Remove the proposition to install pjfry by default, due to many installation problem. The user can still force to 
          install it, if he wants to.
      OM: Fix a problem of madspin when recomputing width for model loaded with --modelname option
      OM: Fix events writing for DIS (thanks to Sho Iwamoto)
      OM: Fix a problem of output files written .lhe.gz, even if not zipped (python2.6 only)
      OM: Fixing some issue related to the customised propagator options of UFO model
 
      Code Re-factorisation:
      ----------------------
      RF: Refactor of the HwU.f fortran code. Gives more flexibility and potentially lower
          memory requirements.
      RF: Refactor of the (NLO) code related to extra weights (for PDF/scale uncertainties).
      OM: Increase modularity of the code for the support of plugin (maddm and MPI@LO)     
          - Now we support the HPC plugin allowing to generate LO-gridpack on MPI machine
          - Plugin can now use the "launch" keyword

2.5.5(26/05/17)
      OM: Fixing bug in the creation of the LO gridpack introduced in 2.4.3. Since 2.4.3 the generated 
          gridpack were lacking to include the generated grid for each channel. This does not lead to 
          bias but to a significant slow down of the associated gridpack.
      OM: Supporting user function calling other non default function.
      OM: adding the command "update to_slha1" and "update to_slha2" (still beta)
      RF: some cleanup in the NLO/Template files. Many unused subroutines deleted.
      OM: fixing some bug related to complex_mass_scheme
      OM: fixing bug in ALOHA for C++ output (in presence of form-factor)
      OM: fixing lhe event for 1 to N process such that the <init> block is consistently set for the shower
      OM: ExRootAnalysis interface is modified (need to be requested as an analysis)
      RF: Fix for FxFx merging in case there are diagrams with 1->3 decays.

2.5.4(28/03/17)
      OM: Add a warning in presense of small width
      OM: Fix a bug related to a missing library (introduced in 2.5.3)
      OM: Improve stability of the onshell mode of MadSpin
      VH: Fix some problem related to LHAPDF

2.5.3(09/03/17)
      PT: Modified the default shower starting scale in montecarlocounter.f.
          The new reference scale from which the dampening profile is computed is sum_i mt_i/2, i
          being Born level final-state momenta.
      OM: New "special mode" for madspin accessible via "set spinmode onshell".
          This mode allow for full spin-correlation with 3 (or more) body decay but the decaying particle
          remains exactly onshell in this mode. Loop-induced production/decay are not allowed in this mode.
      OM+RF: Allowing for creation of LHE like output of the fixed order run at NLO.
          This LHEF file is unvalid for parton-shower (all PS should crash on such file). It will be 
          unphysical to shower such sample anyway.
          Two hidden parameters of the  FO_analyse_card.dat allow some control on the LHEF creation
       	  "fo_lhe_weight_ratio" allows to control the strength of a partial unweighting [default:1e-3]
             increasing this number reduce the LHEF size.
          "fo_lhe_postprocessing" can take value like nogrouping, norandom, noidentification.
             nogrouping forbids the appearance of the LHEF(version2) tag <eventgroup>
             norandom   does not apply the randomization of the events.
             noidentification does not merge born event with other born like counter-event
      RF: Better job handling for fNLO runs.
      VH: Fixing various problem with the pythia8 interface (especially for MLM merging)
      Team: Fixing a series of small crash

2.5.2(10/12/16)
      OM: improve systematics (thanks to Philipp Pigard)
      OM: new syntax to modify the run_card: set no_parton_cut
          This removes all the cut present in the card.
      OM: change the default configuration parameter cluster_local_path to None
      OM: change the syscalc syntax for the pdf to avoid using & since this is not xml compliant
      OM: avoid to bias module to include trivial weight in gridpack mode
      OM: Fix a bug making 2.5.1 not compatible with python2.6
      OM: Improve "add missing" command if a full block is missing
      OM: Fixing a bug reporting wrong cross-section in the lhef <init> flag (only in presence of 
          more than 80 channel of integration)

2.5.1 (04/11/16)
       PT+MZ: New interface for Herwig7.
              Fixed a bug in the Herwig7/Herwig++ counterterm (relevant to 2 -> n, n>2:
              in particular, the bug affected the dead zone for final-final colour connection
              in processes with more than two particles in the Born final state)
       VH: Parallelization of PY8 at LO
       OM: add the possibility to automatically missing parameter in a param_card
           with command "update missing" at the time of the card edition. Usefull for 
           some SUSY card where some block entry are sometimes missing.
       OM: Possibility to automatically run systematics program at NLO or Turn it off at LO
           (hidden entry of the run_card systematics_program = systematics|syscalc|none)
       RF: Some refactoring of the NLO phase-space generation,
           including some small improvements in efficiency.
       OM: Plugin can be include in a directory MG5aMC_PLUGIN the above directory need to be in
           the $PYTHONPATH
       OM: Fix systematics for e+ e- initial state.
       VH: Fix various bug in the HepMc handling related to PY8 (LO generation)
       OM: allow install maddm functionality (install ./bin/maddm executable)

       OM: Introduces a new function for LO/NLO interface "systematics"
            This function allows to compute systematics uncertainty from the event sample
            It requires the event sample to have been generated with 
                - use_syst = T (for LO sample)
                - store_reweight_info = T (for NLO sample)
            At LO the code is run automatically if use_syst=T (but if SysCalc is installed)
       VH+OM: Adding the possibility to bias the event weight for LO generation  via plugin.
            More informtion: https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/LOEventGenerationBias

       OM: Modify the structure of the output format such that all the internal format have the same structure
       OM: Adding the Plugin directory. Three kind of plugin are currently supported
           - plugin defining a new type of output format
           - plugin defining a new type of cluster handling
           - plugin modifying the main interface of MG5aMCnlo

       VH: Interfaced MadLoop to COLLIER for tensor integral reduction.	   
       OM+VH: At the first loop/NLO computation, a new question will now be asked to choose which program
           to install to compute the loop. You can still install additional method later via the "install" command
       OM: Replace the mssm model by the MSSM_SLHA2 following the SLHA2 instead of the SLHA1 convention

     BUG FIXING
     ----------
       OM: Fix a bug in the helicity by helicity reweighting method. (introduced in 2.4.3)
       OM: Fix a bug in the reweight_card where relative path was not understood from the local directory 
            where the program was runned by the user.

2.4.3 (01/08/16)
        OM: Reduce the amount of log file/output generated for LO run (output can use up to three times less output).
        OM: For the LO combination of events (unweighting) pass to the method previously used for loop-induced.
            This method is faster and requires less I/O operation.
            This fully remove the need of the file events.lhe.gz which is not created anymore (further reduce the ouput size)
        OM: Optimise the code in order to be able to run scan with more than 2k steps.
        OM: Optimise the lhe_parser module (use for the unweighting/re-weighing/...) around 20% faster than before.
        OM: Fix a bug in MadSpin where the cross-section reported in the <init> block of the LHEF
            was wrongly assigned when multiple process were present in the LHEF and that different Brancing ratio
            were associated to each of those processes.
        RF: For NLO process generation, fix a problem with turning on PDF reweighting with sets that have only a
            single member. Also, allow for reweighting with up to 25 PDF sets (and their error members) for a single run.
        OM: Fixing bug allowing to specify a UFO model by his full path for NLO computation (thanks Zachary Marschal).
        OM: Fixing bug in LO re-weighting in case of helicity by helicity re-weighting. Now the events is boost back in 
            the center of mass frame to ensure consistency with the helicity definition.

2.4.2 (10/06/16)
        OM: fix a compilation problem for non standard gfortran system

        OM: Allow to specify a path for a custom directory where to look for model via the environment 
            variable PYTHONPATH. Note this used AFTER the standard ./models directory

2.4.0 (12/05/16)
        OM: Allowing the proper NLO reweighting for NLO sample
        RF: For NLO processes allow for multiple PDF and scales reweighting, directy by inputting lists
            in the run_card.dat.
        VH: Interfaced MadLoop to Samurai and Ninja (the latter is now the default)
        HS: Turn IREGI to off by default
        MZ: new NLO generation mode. It is more efficient from the memory and CPU point of 
            view, in particular for high-multiplicity processes. 
            Many thanks to Josh Bendavid for his fundamental contribution for this.
            The mode can be enabled with
            > set low_mem_multicore_nlo_generation True
            before generating the process.
        OM: Adding the possibility to use new syntax for tree-level processes:
            QED==2 and QCD>2: The first allows to select exactly a power of the coupling (at amplitude level
            While the second ask for a minimum value.   
        RF: In the PDF uncertainty for fixed-order NLO runs, variations of alphaS were not included.
        OM: In MLM matching, fix a bug where the alpha_s reweighting was not fully applied on some events.

        RF: Fix for factorisation scale setting in FxFx merging when very large difference in scale in the
            non-QCD part of a process. 
        RF: Better discarding of numerical instabilities in the real-emission matrix elements. Only of interested for
	    processes which have jets at Born level, but do not require generation cut (like t-channel single-top). 
        RF: Added an option to the run_card to allow for easier variation of the shower starting scale (NLO only).
        RF: Fixed a problem in the setting of the flavour map used for runs with iAPPL >= 1. 
        RF: Allow for decay processes to compute (partial) decay widths at NLO accuracy (fixed order only).
        OM: (SysCalc interface) Allow to bypass the pdf reweighting/alpsfact reweighting
        MZ: fixed bug related to slurm clusters
	OM: remove the addmasses.py script of running by default on gridpack mode. 
            if you want to have it running, you just have to rename the file madevent/bin/internal/addmasses_optional.py to
            madevent/bin/internal/addmasses_optional.py and it will work as before. (Do not work with SysCalc tag)
        OM: make the code compatible with "python -tt" option

2.3.2.2 (06/09/15)
        VH: Finalized the MG5aMC-GoSam interface

2.3.2(20/08/15)   
        OM: Improve reweighting module. (https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/Reweight)
            New Capabilities: 
             - allow to reweight by loop-induced processes
             - allow to change model 
             - allow to change process definition
             - allow to unweight the sample to have an idea of the statistical power.
             - allow to perform some crude reweighting on NLO sample (reweighting by LO matrix element). NLO
               accuracy is not preserved (in general) for such computation.
            New dependencies:
	     - require the f2py module (part of numpy)
	OM: change the kt-durham cut (at LO) such that particle comming from decay are not impacted if cut_decays
            is on False.
        VH: Fixed the check in helas wavefunction appearance order in an helas diagrams. It failed in cases
	    where additional wf were created during the fix of fermion flow in presence of majorana fermions.         
	RF: Fixed a bug in the aMCFast/ApplGrid interfaced introduced in the previous version.
        OM: Fix a crash when using mssm-no_b_mass model (due to the SLHA1-SLHA2 conversion)
        OM: Fix a bug in the add_time_of_flight function (not called by default) where the displaced vertex information
            was written in second and not in mm as it should. Note that this function can now be run on the flight
	    by adding the following line in the run_card: "  1e-2 = time_of_flight #threshold for the displaced vertex" 
	RF: Small fix that leads to an improvement in the phase-space generation for NLO processes
        OM: Fix a crash introduce in 2.3.0 when running sequentially in the same directory (thanks Gauthier)
        OM: Improve aloha in the case of some expression reduces to pure float.

            NNPDF (like for the old cteq_6m, etc).
	RF: Fixed a bug in the PDF combination in the HwU histograms: there was no consistent use if Hessian
            and Gaussian approaches for MSTW/CTEQ and NNPDF, respectively.
        OM: Fixed a small bug in EWdim6 which was removing a coupling in AZHH interaction.
        OM: improve customize_model function to avoid problem with unity coupling.

                      - cut_decays is now on False by default
                      - nhel can only take 0/1 value. 1 is a real MC over helicity (with importance sampling)
                      - use_syst is set on by default (but for matching where it is keep off)                    
                      - New options added: dynamical_scale_choice, it can take the following value
		            -1 : MadGraph5_aMC@NLO default (different for LO/NLO/ ickkw mode) same as previous version. 
                             0 : Tag reserved for user define dynamical scale (need to be added in setscales.f).
                             1 : Total transverse energy of the event.

			     4 : \sqrt(s), partonic energy 
                OM: Cuts are also applied for 1>N processes (but the default run_card doesn't have any cut).

                    add an option --format=short allowing to print the result in a multi-column format
                OM: Possibility to not transfer pdf file to the node for each job. 
                       This is done via a new option (cluster_local_path) which should contain the pdf set.
                       This path is intented to point to a node specific filesystem.
                    New way to submit job on cluster without writting the command file on the disk.
                OM: Allowing MadSpin to have a mode without full spin-correlation but handling three (and more)

		RF: When requiring more than 1M events for (N)LO+PS runs, do not go to higher precision than 0.001
                    for the grids and cross section (can be overwritten with the req_acc run_card parameter).

                    SysCalc weight from the lhe file (thanks Shin-Shan)
                Team: Fixes to different small bugs / improvement in the error and warning messages
		RF: For aMC runs, If a NAN is found, the code now skips that PS point and continues instead of
		    leading to NAN.
                RF: For fNLO runs the virtuals were included twice in the setting of the integration grids. 
                    This was not leading to any bias in previous version of the code.

2.2.2(06/11/14) OM: Correct a bug in the integration grid (introduces in 2.1.2). This was biasing the cross-section of 
                    processes like a a > mu+ mu- in the Effective Photon Approximation by three order of magnitude.
                    For LHC processes no sizeable effect have been observe so far.
                MZ: some informations for aMC@NLO runs which were before passed via include files are
                    now read at runtime. The size of executables as well as compilation time / memory usage
                    is reduced for complicated processes
                RF: Fix crash #1377187 (check that cuts were consistent with the grouping was too restrictive)

                    library including many processes at once. Useful for interfacing MadLoop to other MC's
                    and already working with Sherpa.
                VH+HS: This branch contains all the fixes for proper treatment of the latest BSM@NLO models 
                    produced by FeynRules@NLO. In particular, the fixed related to the presence of majorana

2.1.0(21/02/14) MADWEIGHT RELEASE:
                ------------------
                
                OM+PA: First Official release of MadWeight inside MG5_aMC
                      Main update:
                        - ISR corrections
                        - possibility to use narrow-width approximation
                        - introducing a module for the pre-selection of the parton-jet assignment.
                        - extended formalism for the transfer function (more generic)
                        - possibility to evaluate the weights for multiple choices of transfer function 
      			  on the same phase-space point. The phase-space is optimized for the first set of 
                          parameters.
		      Speed update:
                        - More efficient way to group the computation for identical process with different final state.
                        - Possibility to Monte-Carlo over the permutation.
                        - More efficient way to choose between the various change of variable.
                        - Possibility to use mint (not compatible with all of the options)
			- Possibility to use sobol for the generation of PS point (sometimes faster than pure 
                          random point generator.

                MadEvent/aMC@NLO UPDATE/BUG FIXING:
 		-----------------------------------

                OM: Fix critical bug (returns wrong cross-section/width) for processes where the center of mass 
                    energy of the beam is lower than 1 GeV. So this has no impact for LHC-collider phenomenology.
                    This can also impact computation of decay-width if the mass of that particle is below 1 GeV.
		RF: Critical bug fixed (introduced in 2.0.2) for fixed order NLO runs that could
		    give the wrong cross section when the phase-space generation is inefficient
                    (like in the case for conflicting Breit-Wigners). This bug did not affect runs
                    with matching to the parton shower.

                MADSPIN UPDATE:
                ---------------
                OM: Allow to use another model for the decay than the one used for the production of events.
                    You are responsible of the consistency of the model in that case.

                OM: Fix a bug in MadSpin preventing the gridpack to run with NLO processes.

2.0.2(07/02/14) RF: Suppressed the writing of the 'ERROR in OneLOop dilog2_r' messages (introduced in the 
                    previous version)
                OM: Fix the bug that the shower_card.dat was wrongly identified as a pythia_card.

                    and sometimes not (which was making the automatic scale computation to crash)
                OM: Change the way to writte the <init> line of the lhe file to take into account
                    - process with more that 100 subprocesses (note that you need to hack the pythia-pgs
                      package to deal with such large number of sub-process
                    - deal with pdf identification number bigger than 1 million.  
                OM: Fixed a bug preventing the Madevent to detect external module (pythia-pgs, syscalc,...)
                    Bug #1271216 (thanks Iwamoto)
                PT: PYTHIA8 scale and pdf variations

2.0.1(20/01/14) OM: Fix a bug in h > l+ l- l+ l- for group_subproceses =False (decay only). A follow up of 
                    the bug fix in 2.0.0
                RF: Replaced the Error#10 in the generation of the phase-space (for NLO) to a Warning#10.
                    In rare cases this error stopped the code, while this was not needed.
                RF: When using non-optimized loop output, the code now also works fine.

                    exists, then this file is use as default param_card for that restriction.
                HS: Updated CutTools to v1.9.2

2.0.0(14/12/13)    CHANGE IN DEFAULT:
                   ------------------
                      OM: Change the Higgs mass to 125 GeV for most of the model (but the susy/v4 one).
                      OM: Change the default energy of collision to 13 TeV.
                      RF: Default renormalisation and factorisation scales are now set to H_T/2. (for aMC only)

                   MadEvent Update:
                   ----------------
                      OM+SF+RF: Add Frixione Photon isolation (also for aMC)
                      OM: Implementation of the reweight module for Leading Order matrix-element
                      JA+OM+AK: Store parameters needed for systematics studies.
                          This can be turned on with the use_syst parameter in
                          run_card.dat.
                          This output can be used to generate event weights for
                          a variety of variational parameters, including scalefact,
                          alpsfact, PDF choice, and matching scale. Note that this require
                          pythia-pgs v2.2 for matching scale.
                      OM+JA+Chia: Implement MadWidth (automatic/smart computation of the widths)
                      OM: Support for Form-Factor defined in the UFO model. and support for model
                          parameter presence inside the Lorentz expression.
                      OM: Support for a arbitrary functions.f file present inside the UFO model. 
                      JA: Included <clustering> tag in matched .lhe output, to be 
                          used together with Pythia 8 CKKW-L matching. This can be 
                          turned off with the clusinfo flag in run_card.dat.
                      JA: New treatment of matching for diagrams that have no
                          corresponding lower-multiplicity diagrams. Jets that
                          are not classified as shower-type emission jets are
                          flagged in the cluster scale info at the end of the event,
                          which is recognized by the Pythia interface in Pythia-PGS
                          package v. 2.2. For such jets, xqcut does not apply. This
                          allows for consistent matching e.g. of p p > w+ b b~ in 
                          the 4-flavor scheme. Note that auto_ptj_mjj must be set to
                          .false. for this to work properly.
                      OM: Change model restriction behavior: two widths with identical are not merged anymore.
                      S.Prestel(via OM): implement KT Durham cut. (thanks to Z. Marshall)
                      OM: Improved check for unresponsive of PBS cluster (thanks J. Mc Fayden)
                      OM: Implement a maximum number (2500) of jobs which can be submitted at the same time
                          by the PBS cluster. This number is currently not editable via configuration file.
                     
                   MadEvent Bug Fixing:
                   --------------------
                      OM: Fix a bug for h > l+ l- l+ l- (introduce in 1.5.9) where the phase-space parametrization 
                          fails to cover the full phase-space. This bugs occurs only if two identical particles decays
                          in identical particles and if both of those particles can't be on-shell simultaneously. 
                      OM: Fix a bug for multi_run sample in presence of negative weights (possible if NLO pdf)
                          The negative weights were not propagated to the merged sample. 
                          (thanks to Sebastien Brochet for the fix)
	         
                   aMC@NLO Update:       ! FIRST OFFICIAL RELEASE WITH NLO CAPABILITIES !
                   ---------------

                       RF: Added FxFx merging
                       RF: Use MC over helicities for the MadLoop virtual corrections.
                       RF: Using "virtual tricks" to reduce the number of PS points for which to include
                           the virtual corrections, leading to a speed up of the code.
                       OM+SF+RF: Add Frixione Photon isolation (also in MadEvent)
                       PA+OM: Fast version of MadSpin implemented (PS generation in Fortran).
		       OM: Allow to have MadSpin in "gridpack mode" (same cards/same decay). 
                           Add in the madspin_card "set ms_dir PATH". If the path didn't exist MS will
                           create the gridpack on that path, otherwise it will reuse the information 
                           (diagram generated, maximum weight of each channel, branching ratio,...)
                           This allow to bypass all the initialization steps BUT is valid only for the 
                           exact same event generation.
                       VH: Fixed set_run.f which incorrectly sets a default value for ptl, drll and
                           etal making the code insensitive to the values set in the run_card.dat 
                       VH: Fixed a bug in MadLoop that doubled the computing time for quad precision
                       VH+RF: Added MadLoop stability information to the log files (and run summary
                           in DEBUG mode).
                       RF: Fixed a stability problem in the reweighting to get PDF and scale uncertainties.
                       VH+RF: Improved the Binoth LHA interface
                       RF: Improved the multi-channeling for processes with more amplitudes than diagrams.
                       RF: Added a new parameter in the run_card to set the required accuracy for fixed 
                           order runs.

                           friendly way.
                       RF: Event normalization is now Les Houches compliant (the weights
		           of the events should average to the total rate). The old normalization
                           can still be chosen by setting the flag 'sum = event_norm' in the run_card.
		       RF: Fixes a bug related to the mass of the tau that was not consistently 
 		           taking into account in the phase-space set-up.
		       VH: Fixed the incorrect implementation of the four gluons R2 in the loop_sm UFO.
		       VH: Fixed the UV renormalization for the SM with massive c quarks.
                       RF: The PDF uncertainty for NNPDF is now also correctly given in the run summary
                       RF: Some improvements in the test_MC and test_ME when matrix elements are
                           numerically very large
                       OM+RF: Added the running at LO to the 'launch questions'
                       OM: Allow "check" command to use a event file.
                           This will use the related param_card and the first
                           event compatible with the requested process.
                       RF: Improved the phase-space generation in the case of competing resonances

                       VH: Fix computation in the Feynman gauge for the loops
                       RF: automatic computation of the NLO uncertainties
                       OM: NLO can now be runned with no central disk
                       MZ: change the format of number (using e and not d)
                       MZ: compilation and tests are possible in multicore
                       RF: allow to precise either uncertainty or number of events
                           for aMC@NLO/NLO
                       OM: ./bin/mg5 cmd.cmd is now working for NLO process

                    From beta1 (31/10/12):
                       aMCatNLO Team: First public (beta) version of aMCatNLO.

                  OM: Add a command print_results in the madevent interface. This command print the 
                      cross-section/number of events/... 
                  OM: change the way prompt color is handle (no systematic reset). Which provides better

                      one W decaying leptonically. For such processes the lepton cuts were also used
                      on the neutrino particle reducing the cross-section. This bug was present only
                      for group_subprocesses=True (the default)

                      If a non-zero seed is given in the run_card, this seed
                      is used as starting value for the SubProcesses/randinit file,
                      while the seed in the run_card is set to 0.
                      This way, the seed for a multi_run is automatically

                      is in general not gauge-invariant. It is in general
                      better to use the $ notation, forbidding only onshell

                       - Change sign convention for Epsilon (matching FR choices)
                       - For Fermion vertex forces that _1 always returns the  
                         incoming fermion and _2 returns the outcoming fermion. 
                         (This modifies conjugate routine output)
                       - Change the order of argument for conjugate routine
                         to expect IO order of fermion in all cases.
                       Note that the two last modifications matches MG5 conventions
                       and that those modifications correct bugs for interactions
                       a) subject to conjugate routine (i.e. if the model has 
                          majorana)                       
                       b) containing fermion momentum dependencies in the Lorentz

                      match (helpfull for constraining to rotation matrix).  
                 OM: Change the import command. It's now allowed to omit the 
                      type of import. The type is guessed automaticaly. 
                      This is NOT allowed on the web.
                 OM: Add a check that the fermion flow is coherent with the 
                      Lorentz structure associates to the vertex.
                 OM: Add a check that the color representation is coherent. 
                      This allow to detect/fix various problem linked
                      to some new models created by FR and SARAH.
                 OM: Change the default fortran compiler to gfortran.
                 OM: Add the possibility to force which fortran compiler will
                      be used, either via the configuration file or via the set 
                      command.
                 OM: Add the possibility to bypass the automatic opening of 
                      the web browser (via the configuration file: 
                      ./input/mg5_configuration.txt )
                 OM: add 'save options' command to save the current configuration 
                      in the configuration file. 
                 OM: Change the scheme of questions when running madevent and 
                      allow to specify in the command interface if you
                      want to run pythia/pgs/...
                      Allow to put the answers to the questions in the 
                      proc_card.dat.
                 OM: Add options for the display command:
                      a) display options: return the current option value. 
                        i.e. those set via the set command and/or via the 
                        configuration file
                      b) display variable NAME: return the current string 
                        representation of NAME and/or self.NAME .
                      c) display coupling_order: return the coupling orders with
                        their associated weight (for automatic order restriction)
                      d) display couplings now returns the list of all couplings
                        with the associated expression

                         in arguments 
                 OM: New Python script for the creation of the various html pages.
                      This Requires less disk access for the generation of the files.
                 OM: Modify error treatment, especially for Invalid commands
                      and Configuration problems.
                 JA: Ensure that we get zero cross section if we have
                      non-parton initial states with proton/antiproton beams
                 OM: Improve cluster support. MadEvent now supports PBS/Condor/SGE
                      Thanks to Arian Abrahantes for the SGE implementation.
                 OM: Improve auto-completion (better output/dealing with multi line/...)
                 OM: Improve the parallel suite and change the release script to run
                      some of the parallel tests. This ensures even higher stability 
                      of the  code for the future releases.
                 JA: Changed the way gridpacks work: Set granularity to 1
                      (so randomly select channels only if they should generate 
                      less than 1 event), but allowing channels to run down to a single
                      iteration. This removes all old problems with increased
                      variance for small channels in the gridpacks, while giving 
                      even faster event generation.

                 Thanks to Johan Alwall, Sho Iwamoto for all the important 
                 testing/bug reports.


1.3.33 (01/01/12) JA: Revisited colors for propagators in addmothers.f
                      to ensure that propagators in color flow
                      violating processes get the correct color
                      from initial state particles (thanks to
                      Michele Gabusi for forcing me to do this).

1.3.32 (21/12/11) JA: Fixed a bug in the PDF reweighting routine,
                      which caused skewed eta distributions for
                      matched samples with pdfwgt=T. Thanks to Giulio

1.3.28 (14/11/11) OM+JA: Fix special case when Lorentz structure combining
                      two different Majorana particles depends on the
                      incoming/outgoing status of the Majorana particles
                      (needed for MSSM with Goldstino).
                  JA: Fixed problem with colors in addmothers.f for complicated
                      multiparticle vertices and simplified color treatment 
                      (thanks to Gauthier Durieux for pointing this out).

                  OM: Update the parallel test (now testing against MG5 1.3.3)
                  OM: Include some parallel test in the release script.


1.3.27 (05/11/11) JA: Fix bug in mirrored amplitudes (sometimes
                      amplitudes that should not be flagged as
                      mirrored were flagged as mirrored). Thanks
                      Marco Zaro for reporting this!
                  JA: Fix another problem getting enough events in
                      gridpack mode (it was not completely fixed in
                      v. 1.3.24). Thanks Alexis!
                  JA: Added "!" comments for all parameters in the default
                      run_card, since apparently this is still needed
                      for g77 to correctly read the parameters.
 
1.3.26 (31/10/11) JA: Fix color setting in MadEvent event file for
                      multiparticle vertices, which was not taken into
                      account in the upgrade in v. 1.3.18

1.3.25 (27/10/11) JA: Ensure that the correct intermediate resonance
                      is always written in the event file, even when we
                      have resonances with identical properties.
                  OM: Fix the bug forcing to quit the web browser in order to

                      after the output command. 

1.3.24 (22/10/11) JA: Fix problem with getting enough events in gridpack
                      mode (this was broken in v. 1.3.11 when we moved
                      from events to luminocity in refine). Thanks to
                      Alexis Kalogeropoulos.

1.3.23 (19/10/11) JA: Allow user to set scales using setscales.f again 
                      (this was broken in v. 1.3.18). Thanks to Arindam Das.
                  JA: Ensure that the error message is displayed if the
                     "make" command is not installed on the system.
 
1.3.22 (12/10/11) JA: Fixed another bug (also introduced in 1.3.18), which 
                      could give the wrong ordering between the s-channel 
                      propagators for certain multiprocess cases (this
                      also lead to a hard stop, so don't worry, if you get 
                      your events, the bug doesn't affect you). Sorry about
                      that, this is what happens when you add a lot of
                      new functionality...

1.3.21 (12/10/11) OM: Add a new command: install.
                      This allow to install quite easily different package
                      devellop for Madgraph/MadEvent. The list of available
                      package are pythia-pgs/MadAnalysis/ExRootAnalysis/Delphes
                  OM: Adding TopEffth Model

                  JA: Fixed bug in cluster.f that created a hard stop,
                      introduced in 1.3.18.

1.3.20 (09/10/11) JA: Fixed bug in myamp.f that created a hard stop
                      error for certain cases with many processes with
                      different propagators in the same subprocess dir.

1.3.19 (06/10/11) JA: Fixed problem with SubProcesses makefile on Linux,
                      introduced in 1.3.18.

1.3.18 (04/10/11) JA: Use model information to determine color of particles
                      for reweighting and propagator color info.
                  JA: Changed the definition of "forbidden s-channels"
                      denoted by "$" to exclude on-shell s-channels while
                      keeping all diagrams (i.e., complemetary to the decay
                      chain formalism). This reduces the problems with 
                      gauge invariance compared to previously.
                      "Onshell" is as usual defined by the "bwcutoff" flag 
                      in the run_card.dat.
                  JA: Enable proper 4-flavor matching (such as gg>hbb~+jets)
                      Note that you need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.9 or 
                      later to use with 4F matching.
                      Changes include: alpha_s reweighting also for b vertices,
                      new scale treatment (mu_F for pp>hbb~ is (pT_b^max*m_Th)),
                      no clustering of gluons to final-state massive particles
                      in MadEvent.
                  JA: Ensure that factorization scale settings and matching works
                      also in singlet t-channel exchange processes like
                      single top and VBF. The dynamic factorization
                      scale is given by the pT of the scattered quark
                      (on each side of the event).
                Note: You need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.10 or later
                      to use with VBF matching, to ensure that both radiated
                      and scattered partons are treated correctly
                      - scattered partons need to be excluded from the matching,
                      since their pT can be below QCUT. An even better
                      treatment would require to individually shower and match
                      the two sides in Pythia, which is not presently possible.
                Note: In the matched 4-flavor process p p > t b~ j $ w+ w- t~ +
                      p p > t b~ j j $ w+ w- t~, there is an admixture
                      of t-channel single top (with up to 1 radiated jet) 
                      and s-channel single top (with up to 2 radiated jets). 
                      In this case, the automatic determination of maximum 
                      multiplicity sample doesn't work (since max in the file 
                      will be 2 jets, but for t-channel max is 1 jet).
                      So MAXJETS=1 must be specified in the pythia_card.dat.
                  JA: Fixed pdf reweighting for matching, which due to a mistake
                      had never been activated.
                  JA: Improved phase space integration presetting further by 
                      taking into account special cuts like xpt, ht etc.
                  JA: Introduce new convention for invariant mass cuts
                      - if max < min, exclude intermediate range
                      (allows to exclude W/Z dijet resonances in VBF processes)

1.3.17 (30/09/11) OM: Fix a crash created by ALOHA when it tries to create the full
                      set of ALOHA routines (pythia8 output only).

1.3.16 (11/09/11) JA: Fixed the problem from 1.3.12.

                      (No events in output for some given processes)

1.3.14 (08/09/11) OM: Fix a bug in the RS model introduced in 1.3.8

1.3.13 (05/09/11) JA: Fixed bug with cut_decays=F which removed cuts also for
                      non-decay products in certain channels if there is
                      a forced decay present. Note that this does not affect
                      xqcut, only pt, minv and eta cuts.
                  JA: If non-zero phase space cutoff, don't use minimum of
                      1 GeV (this allows to go to e.g. 2m_e invariant mass for
                      \gamma* > e+ e-).

1.3.12 (01/09/11) JA: Fixed problem with decay chains when different decays
                      result in identical final states, such as
                      p p > go go, (go > b1/b1~ b/b~, b1/b1~ > b/b~ n1)
                      (only one of the decay chains was chosen, instead of
                      all 3 combinations (b1,b1), (b1,b1~), (b1~,b1~))
                  JA: Allow for overall orders also with grouped subprocesses
                  JA: Ensure that only leading color flows are included in event
                      output (so no singlet flows from color octets).
                  JA: Fixed small bug in fermion flow determination for multifermion
                      vertices.

1.3.11 (26/08/11) JA: Improved precision of "survey" by allowing 4th and 5th 
                      iteration if accuracy after 3 iterations < 10%.
                  JA: Subdivide BW in phase space integration for conflicting BWs 
                      also for forced decays, to improve generation with large
                      bwcutoff in e.g. W+ W- production with decays.
                  JA: Do refine using luminocity instead of number of events,
                      to work with badly determined channels.
                  JA: Don't use BW for shat if mass > sqrt(s).
                  JA: Fixed insertion of colors for octet resonances decaying to 
                      octet+singlet (thanks Bogdan for finding this)

1.3.10 (23/08/11) OM: Update ALOHA version
                  OM: increase waiting time for jobs to write physically the results on
                      the disks (in ordre to reduce trouble on the cluster).

1.3.9 (01/08/11)  OM: Add a new model DY_SM (arXiv:1107.5830). Thanks to Neil 
                      for the generation of the model 

1.3.8 (25/07/11)  JA: Replace the SM and HEFT models with latest versions using
                      the Wolfenstein parameterization for the CKM matrix.
                  JA: Implemented reading of the new UFO information about
                      coupling orders (order hierarchy and expansion_order).
                  JA: New "coupling order" specification WEIGHTED which checks
                      for  sum of coupling orders weighted by their hierarchy.
                  JA: Implemented optimal coupling orders for processes from any
                      model if no coupling orders specified.

1.3.7 (21/07/11)  JA: Fix makefiles for some v4 models that were forgotten
                      in v. 1.3.5

1.3.6 (18/07/11)  OM: Ensure that the new makefiles work on the web

1.3.5 (14/07/11): JA: New organization of make files, ensure that compilation works 
                      for all modes (with/without LHAPDF, static/dynamic, 
                      regular/gridpack) for both Linux and Mac OS X (be careful with 
                      dynamic libraries on Mac OS X though, since it seems that 
                      common blocks might not work properly)
                  JA: Fixed proper error messages and clean stop for compilation 
                      errors during MadEvent run.

1.3.4 (05/07/11): OM: More informative error message when a compilation error occurs
