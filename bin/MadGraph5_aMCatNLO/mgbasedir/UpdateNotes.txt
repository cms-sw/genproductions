Update notes for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (in reverse time order)

2.6.5 (03/02/19)
      OM: Fix some speed issue with the generated gridpack --speed issue introduced in 2.6.1--
      OM: Fix a bug in the computation of systematics when running with Python 2.6.
      OM: import model PATH, where PATH does not exists yet, will now connect to the online db
          if the model_name is present in the online db, then the model will be installed in the specified path.
      MZ: Applgrid+aMCFast was broken for some processes (since 2.6.0), due to wrong 
          information written into initial_states_map.dat. This has been fixed now
      OM: change in the gridpack. It automatically runs the systematics.py (if configure in the run_card)
      OM: Fix  a MLM crash occuring for p p > go go (0,1,2 j)
      OM: Fix issue for BSM model with additional colored particle where the default dynamical scale choice 
          was crashing

2.6.4 (09/11/18)
      OM: add specific treatement for small width (at LO only and not for loop-induced)
          if the width is smaller than 1e-6 times the mass, a fake width (at that value) is used for the
          numerical evaluation of the matrix-element. S-channel resonances are re-scaled according to 
          narrow-width approximation to return the correct total cross-section (the distribution of events 
          will on the other hand follow the new width). 
          The parameter '1e-6' can be changed by adding to (LO) run_card the parameter: "small_width_treatment"
      OM: add a new command "install looptools" to trigger the question that is automatically trigger 
          the first time a loop computation is needed.
      RF: Fixed a bug when using TopDrawer plots for f(N)LO runs, where the combination of the plots could lead
          to completely wrong histograms/distributions in case of high-precision runs.
      OM: Fix some MLM crash for some processes (in particular BSM processes with W'). 
      OM: Fix a bug in the reweighting due to the new lhe format (the one avoiding some issue with py8)
      OM: Fix a behavior for negative mass, the width was set to negative in the param_card automatically
          making the Parton-shower (and other code) to crash since this does not follow the convention.
      OM: Change compiler flag to support Mojave.

2.6.3.2 (22/06/18)
      OM: Fix a bug in auto-width when mass are below QCD scale.
      OM: Fix a bug for g b initial state where the mass in the lhe file was not always correctly assigned
          Note that the momentum was fine (i.e. in the file P^2 was not equal to the mention M but to the correct one)
      OM: Improvment for madspin in the mode spinmode=none
      OM: Fix a bug in MadSpin which was making MadSpin to work only in debug mode

2.6.3 (15/06/18)
      OM: When importing model, we now run one additional layer of optimisation:
           - if a vertex as two identical coupling for the same color structure then the associated lorentz 
             structure are merged in a single one and the vertex is modified accordingly
      OM: When restricting a model, we also run one additional layer of optimisation
           - Opposite sign coupling are now identified and merged into a single one
           - if a vertex as two identical coupling (up to the sign) for the same color structure
             then the associated lorentz structure are merged in a single one and the 
             vertex is modified accordingly 
      VH+OM: changing the ALOHA naming scheme for combine routine when the function name starts to be too long. 
      OM: adding a hidden parameter to the run_card (python_seed) to allow to control the randon number 
          generated within python and be able to have full reproducibility of the events
      OM: Fixing some issue with the default dynamical scale choice for 
            - non minimal QED sample
            - heft model when multiple radiation coming from the higgs decay/scattering
          This can also impact MLM since it use the same definition for the dynamical scale
      OM: Fix some issue for DIS scattering where the shat was wrongly defined for low energy scattering.
          Low energy scattering are not adviced since they break the factorization theorem.
          In particular the z-boost of the events are quite ill defined in that scenario.
      OM: changing the format of the param_card for NLO model to match expectation from the latest PY8
      OM: Update of MadSpin to allow special input file for the case of spinmode=none. 
          With that very simple mode of decay, you can now decay hepmc file or wrongly formatted leshouches event
          (in that mode we do not have spin correlation and width effect)
      PT: in montecarlocounter.f: improved colour-flow treatment in the case gluons are twice colour-connected to each other
          new gfunction(w) to get smoothly to 0 as w -> 1. (for NLO+PS run)
      OM: Fix some issue for the new QED model (including one in the handling of complex mass scheme of such model)
      OM: Fixing an issue of the param_card out of sync when running compute-widths
      OM: Adding Qnumbers block for ghost (the latest version of py8 was crashing due to their absence)

2.6.2 (29/04/18)

      Heavy ion pdf / pdf in general:
      -------------------------------
      OM: Support for rescaling PDF to ion PDF (assuming independent hadron), this is well suited for Lead-Lead collision, p-Lead collision and fix-target
      OM: Support in systematics.py for ion pdf. Possiblity to rescale only one beam (usefull to change only on PDF for fix target experiment)
      OM: Removing internal support for old type of PDF (only supported internal pdf are now cteq6 and nnpdf23)


      User Interface
      --------------
      OM: introduce "update to_full" command to display all the hidden parameter.
      OM: introduce "update ion_pdf" and "update beam_pol" to add related section in the run_card.
          the polarization of the beam is set as hidden parameter instead as default parameter
      OM: improve handling of (some) run_card parameter:
            - add comment that can be displayed via "help NAME"
            - add autocompletion for some parameter
            - add direct rejection of parameter edition if not in some allowed list/range
      
      Bug fixes:
      ----------
      OM: Fix issue with madspin introduced in 2.6.1 (failing to generate correct diagram for NLO process)
      OM: fix crash in 1>N reweighting
      RF+MZ: Fixed a problem with (f)NLO(+PS) runs in case the Born has identical QCD-charged
      	     particles. Cross sections were typically correct, but some distributions might
	     have shown an asymmetry. 
      OM: Change in LO maching for HEFT (or any model with hgg vertex) in the way to flag jet that should
          not take part in the matching/merging procedure.
      OM: Fixed a bug for loop induced in gridpack mode
      RF: Fixed a bug for ApplGrid: in rare cases the ApplGrid tables were filled twice for the same event
      OM: Fixed a bug for fixed target experiment when the energy of the beam was set to 0. 
      RF: Fixed an issue where too many files were opened for fNLO runs in rare cases
      OM: Fix issue on Madevent html output where some link where broken
      OM: Fix issue for the display lorentz function (was also presenting security issue for online use)
      OM: Fix issue for spin 3/2 (one in presence of fermion flow violation and one for custom propagator)

      Enhancement:
      -----------
      OM: add the value of all the widths in Auto-width in the scan summary file
      OM: For 1>N, if the user set fixed_run_scale to True, then the scale is choose accordingly
          and not following the mass of the inital state anymore
      RF: For the HwU histograms, if no gnuplot installation is found, write the gnuplot scripts in v5
          format (instead of the very old v4 format).
      OM: Change the default LO output directory structure. Now by default the lepton and neutrino are split 
          in two different directory. This avoids to face problem with the assymetric cut on lepton/neutrino
      OM: loop-filter commands are now working for loop-induced processes
      OM: New  method avoiding that two process are running inside the same output directory.
          This is implemented only for Gridpack and LO run so far. 
          The new method should be more robust in case of crash (i.e. not wrongly trigger as before)
      OM: For LO scan, if a crash (or ctrl-c) occurs during the scan, the original param_card is now
          restored.

2.6.1 (12/12/17)

      RF+MZ: It is now possible to add LO matrix elements (with [LOonly]) 
             to Fx-Fx merged samples. Thanks to Josh Bendavid for testing.
      OM: Re-factoring the code asking which program to use (both at LO and NLO)
          - design modular, designed for PLUGIN interactions
          - the length of the question auto adapts to the size of the shell
      OM: Allowing to have the gridpack stored on a readonly filesystem
      OM: Fix a bug in matching/merging forbiding the pdf reweighting for some processes (since 2.4.0)
      OM: Creation of online database with the name of known UFO model. If a use try to import a model
          which does not exits locally, the code will automatically check that database and download the 
          associate model if it exists. You can contact us if you are the author of one model which is not
          on our database. 
	  The list of all available model is available by typing "display model_list"
      OM: Model with __arxiv__ attribute will display "please cite XXXX.XXXXX when using this model" when
          loaded for the first time.
      OM: A fail of importing a UFO model does not try anymore to import v4 model
      OM: Many model present in models directory have been removed, however they can still be imported
          since they are available via automatic-download
      OM: Refactoring of the gridpack functionality with an infinite loop to reach the requested number of events
      OM+RF: Adding new class of cut at LO/NLO defined via the pdg of the particle
      VH: Support for the latest version of MA5
      MZ: Adding support for lhapdf v6.2
      OM: Fixing various bug in the spinmode=onshell mode of MadSpin

      OM: Fix aloha bug in presence of complex form-factor.
      OM: improve auto-detection and handling of slha1/slha2 input file when expecting slha2. 

2.6.0 (16/08/17)
      New Functionalities:
      --------------------
      RF+OM: Added the possibility to also have a bias-function for event generation at (f)NLO(+PS)
      OM: Improve Re-WEIGHTING module
          1) creation of a single library by hyppothesis. 
          2) library for new hyppothesis can be specify via the new
             options: change tree_path and change virt_path
          3) allows to re-weight with different mass in the final states (LO only)
             This forces to rewrite a new lhe file, not adding weight inside the file
             (via the command: change output 2.0)
          4) allows to run the systematics on the newly generated file (for new output file)
             (via the command change systematics True)
          5) Fix some Nan issue for NLO reweighting in presence of colinear emission
	  6) various bug fixing, speed improvement,...
      OM: Add new option to SYSTEMATICS program:
           --remove_weights, --keep_weights, --start_id
           See "help systematics for more details."
      OM: Allow to specify param_card, run_card,... directly via an html link.

      Bug Fixing:
      -----------
      OM: Update condor class to support CERN type of cluster (thanks Daria Satco)
      OM: Fixing a bug leading to a crash in pythia8 due to one event wrongly written when splitting the
          events for the parralelization of pythia8
      OM: Fixing an issue, leading to NAN for some of the channel of integration for complicated processes.
      OM: Fix a bug in gripack@NLO which forbids to run it when the gridpack was generated with 0 events.
      RF: Fixed bug #1694548 (problem with NLO for QCD-charged heavy vector bosons).
      RF: Another fix (adding on a fix in 2.5.5) related to FxFx merging in case there are
      RF: Fixed bug #1706072 related to wrong path with NLO gridpack mode
          diagrams with 1->3 decays.
      RF: Fixed a bug (found by SF) that gave a seriously biased resonance mass when using MadSpin for decaying a 2->1 process.
      PT: Fix in montecarlocounter.f. Previously, for NLO+PS it was reading some subleading-colour information, now all
          information passed to the MC counterterms is correctly leading colour. 
      OM: Fix systematics computation for lepton collider
      OM+VH: Remove the proposition to install pjfry by default, due to many installation problem. The user can still force to 
          install it, if he wants to.
      OM: Fix a problem of madspin when recomputing width for model loaded with --modelname option
      OM: Fix events writing for DIS (thanks to Sho Iwamoto)
      OM: Fix a problem of output files written .lhe.gz, even if not zipped (python2.6 only)
      OM: Fixing some issue related to the customised propagator options of UFO model
 
      Code Re-factorisation:
      ----------------------
      RF: Refactor of the HwU.f fortran code. Gives more flexibility and potentially lower
          memory requirements.
      RF: Refactor of the (NLO) code related to extra weights (for PDF/scale uncertainties).
      OM: Increase modularity of the code for the support of plugin (maddm and MPI@LO)     
          - Now we support the HPC plugin allowing to generate LO-gridpack on MPI machine
          - Plugin can now use the "launch" keyword

2.5.5(26/05/17)
      OM: Fixing bug in the creation of the LO gridpack introduced in 2.4.3. Since 2.4.3 the generated 
          gridpack were lacking to include the generated grid for each channel. This does not lead to 
          bias but to a significant slow down of the associated gridpack.
      OM: Supporting user function calling other non default function.
      OM: adding the command "update to_slha1" and "update to_slha2" (still beta)
      RF: some cleanup in the NLO/Template files. Many unused subroutines deleted.
      OM: fixing some bug related to complex_mass_scheme
      OM: fixing bug in ALOHA for C++ output (in presence of form-factor)
      OM: fixing lhe event for 1 to N process such that the <init> block is consistently set for the shower
      OM: ExRootAnalysis interface is modified (need to be requested as an analysis)
      RF: Fix for FxFx merging in case there are diagrams with 1->3 decays.

2.5.4(28/03/17)
      OM: Add a warning in presense of small width
      OM: Fix a bug related to a missing library (introduced in 2.5.3)
      OM: Improve stability of the onshell mode of MadSpin
      VH: Fix some problem related to LHAPDF

2.5.3(09/03/17)
      PT: Modified the default shower starting scale in montecarlocounter.f.
          The new reference scale from which the dampening profile is computed is sum_i mt_i/2, i
          being Born level final-state momenta.
      OM: New "special mode" for madspin accessible via "set spinmode onshell".
          This mode allow for full spin-correlation with 3 (or more) body decay but the decaying particle
          remains exactly onshell in this mode. Loop-induced production/decay are not allowed in this mode.
      OM+RF: Allowing for creation of LHE like output of the fixed order run at NLO.
          This LHEF file is unvalid for parton-shower (all PS should crash on such file). It will be 
          unphysical to shower such sample anyway.
          Two hidden parameters of the  FO_analyse_card.dat allow some control on the LHEF creation
       	  "fo_lhe_weight_ratio" allows to control the strength of a partial unweighting [default:1e-3]
             increasing this number reduce the LHEF size.
          "fo_lhe_postprocessing" can take value like nogrouping, norandom, noidentification.
             nogrouping forbids the appearance of the LHEF(version2) tag <eventgroup>
             norandom   does not apply the randomization of the events.
             noidentification does not merge born event with other born like counter-event
      RF: Better job handling for fNLO runs.
      VH: Fixing various problem with the pythia8 interface (especially for MLM merging)
      Team: Fixing a series of small crash

2.5.2(10/12/16)
      OM: improve systematics (thanks to Philipp Pigard)
      OM: new syntax to modify the run_card: set no_parton_cut
          This removes all the cut present in the card.
      OM: change the default configuration parameter cluster_local_path to None
      OM: change the syscalc syntax for the pdf to avoid using & since this is not xml compliant
      OM: avoid to bias module to include trivial weight in gridpack mode
      OM: Fix a bug making 2.5.1 not compatible with python2.6
      OM: Improve "add missing" command if a full block is missing
      OM: Fixing a bug reporting wrong cross-section in the lhef <init> flag (only in presence of 
          more than 80 channel of integration)

2.5.1 (04/11/16)
       PT+MZ: New interface for Herwig7.
              Fixed a bug in the Herwig7/Herwig++ counterterm (relevant to 2 -> n, n>2:
              in particular, the bug affected the dead zone for final-final colour connection
              in processes with more than two particles in the Born final state)
       VH: Parallelization of PY8 at LO
       OM: add the possibility to automatically missing parameter in a param_card
           with command "update missing" at the time of the card edition. Usefull for 
           some SUSY card where some block entry are sometimes missing.
       OM: Possibility to automatically run systematics program at NLO or Turn it off at LO
           (hidden entry of the run_card systematics_program = systematics|syscalc|none)
       RF: Some refactoring of the NLO phase-space generation,
           including some small improvements in efficiency.
       OM: Plugin can be include in a directory MG5aMC_PLUGIN the above directory need to be in
           the $PYTHONPATH
       OM: Fix systematics for e+ e- initial state.
       VH: Fix various bug in the HepMc handling related to PY8 (LO generation)
       OM: allow install maddm functionality (install ./bin/maddm executable)

	        More information at https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/UseMA5withinMG5aMC	   
       OM: Introduces a new function for LO/NLO interface "systematics"
            This function allows to compute systematics uncertainty from the event sample
            It requires the event sample to have been generated with 
                - use_syst = T (for LO sample)
                - store_reweight_info = T (for NLO sample)
            At LO the code is run automatically if use_syst=T (but if SysCalc is installed)
       VH+OM: Adding the possibility to bias the event weight for LO generation  via plugin.
            More informtion: https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/LOEventGenerationBias
       VH+SP: extend support for CKKWL

     CODE IMPROVMENT / small feature
     -------------------------------
       OM: Modify the structure of the output format such that all the internal format have the same structure
       OM: Adding the Plugin directory. Three kind of plugin are currently supported
           - plugin defining a new type of output format
           - plugin defining a new type of cluster handling
           - plugin modifying the main interface of MG5aMCnlo 
           More informations/examples are available here:
           https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/Plugin

       VH: extend install command to install: lhapdf/pythia8
       VH: Interfaced MadLoop to COLLIER for tensor integral reduction.	   
       OM+VH: At the first loop/NLO computation, a new question will now be asked to choose which program
           to install to compute the loop. You can still install additional method later via the "install" command
       OM: Replace the mssm model by the MSSM_SLHA2 following the SLHA2 instead of the SLHA1 convention

     BUG FIXING
     ----------
       OM: Fix a bug in the helicity by helicity reweighting method. (introduced in 2.4.3)
       OM: Fix a bug in the reweight_card where relative path was not understood from the local directory 
            where the program was runned by the user.

2.4.3 (01/08/16)
        OM: Reduce the amount of log file/output generated for LO run (output can use up to three times less output).
        OM: For the LO combination of events (unweighting) pass to the method previously used for loop-induced.
            This method is faster and requires less I/O operation.
            This fully remove the need of the file events.lhe.gz which is not created anymore (further reduce the ouput size)
        OM: Optimise the code in order to be able to run scan with more than 2k steps.
        OM: Optimise the lhe_parser module (use for the unweighting/re-weighing/...) around 20% faster than before.
        OM: Fix a bug in MadSpin where the cross-section reported in the <init> block of the LHEF
            was wrongly assigned when multiple process were present in the LHEF and that different Brancing ratio
            were associated to each of those processes.
        RF: For NLO process generation, fix a problem with turning on PDF reweighting with sets that have only a
            single member. Also, allow for reweighting with up to 25 PDF sets (and their error members) for a single run.
        OM: Fixing bug allowing to specify a UFO model by his full path for NLO computation (thanks Zachary Marschal).
        OM: Fixing bug in LO re-weighting in case of helicity by helicity re-weighting. Now the events is boost back in 
            the center of mass frame to ensure consistency with the helicity definition.

2.4.2 (10/06/16)
        OM: fix a compilation problem for non standard gfortran system
        OM: reduce the need of lhapdf for standard LO run. (was making some run to test due to missing dependencies)

2.4.1 (10/06/16)
        OM: Fix a bug in fix target experiment with PDF on the particle at rest.
            The cross-section was correct but the z-boost was not performed correctly.
        OM: Fix various bug in MadSpin
        OM: Fix some bug in MLM merging, where chcluster was forced to True (introduced in 2.2.0)
        OM: Allow to specify a path for a custom directory where to look for model via the environment 
            variable PYTHONPATH. Note this used AFTER the standard ./models directory

2.4.0 (12/05/16)
        OM: Allowing the proper NLO reweighting for NLO sample
        RF: For NLO processes allow for multiple PDF and scales reweighting, directy by inputting lists
            in the run_card.dat.
        VH: Interfaced MadLoop to Samurai and Ninja (the latter is now the default)
        HS: Turn IREGI to off by default
        MZ: new NLO generation mode. It is more efficient from the memory and CPU point of 
            view, in particular for high-multiplicity processes. 
            Many thanks to Josh Bendavid for his fundamental contribution for this.
            The mode can be enabled with
            > set low_mem_multicore_nlo_generation True
            before generating the process.
        OM: Adding the possibility to use new syntax for tree-level processes:
            QED==2 and QCD>2: The first allows to select exactly a power of the coupling (at amplitude level
            While the second ask for a minimum value.   
        RF: In the PDF uncertainty for fixed-order NLO runs, variations of alphaS were not included.
        OM: In MLM matching, fix a bug where the alpha_s reweighting was not fully applied on some events.

        MZ: fixed bug related to slurm clusters
	OM: remove the addmasses.py script of running by default on gridpack mode. 
            if you want to have it running, you just have to rename the file madevent/bin/internal/addmasses_optional.py to
            madevent/bin/internal/addmasses_optional.py and it will work as before. (Do not work with SysCalc tag)

             - allow to change model 
             - allow to change process definition
             - allow to unweight the sample to have an idea of the statistical power.
             - allow to perform some crude reweighting on NLO sample (reweighting by LO matrix element). NLO
               accuracy is not preserved (in general) for such computation.
            New dependencies:
	     - require the f2py module (part of numpy)

	    by adding the following line in the run_card: "  1e-2 = time_of_flight #threshold for the displaced vertex" 
	RF: Small fix that leads to an improvement in the phase-space generation for NLO processes
        OM: Fix a crash introduce in 2.3.0 when running sequentially in the same directory (thanks Gauthier)

                      - cut_decays is now on False by default
                      - nhel can only take 0/1 value. 1 is a real MC over helicity (with importance sampling)
                      - use_syst is set on by default (but for matching where it is keep off)                    
                      - New options added: dynamical_scale_choice, it can take the following value
		            -1 : MadGraph5_aMC@NLO default (different for LO/NLO/ ickkw mode) same as previous version. 
                             0 : Tag reserved for user define dynamical scale (need to be added in setscales.f).

			     4 : \sqrt(s), partonic energy 
                OM: Cuts are also applied for 1>N processes (but the default run_card doesn't have any cut).

                       This is done via a new option (cluster_local_path) which should contain the pdf set.
                       This path is intented to point to a node specific filesystem.
                    New way to submit job on cluster without writting the command file on the disk.

		RF: When requiring more than 1M events for (N)LO+PS runs, do not go to higher precision than 0.001
                    for the grids and cross section (can be overwritten with the req_acc run_card parameter).

		RF: For aMC runs, If a NAN is found, the code now skips that PS point and continues instead of
		    leading to NAN.
                RF: For fNLO runs the virtuals were included twice in the setting of the integration grids. 
                    This was not leading to any bias in previous version of the code.

2.2.2(06/11/14) OM: Correct a bug in the integration grid (introduces in 2.1.2). This was biasing the cross-section of 
                    processes like a a > mu+ mu- in the Effective Photon Approximation by three order of magnitude.
                    For LHC processes no sizeable effect have been observe so far.
                MZ: some informations for aMC@NLO runs which were before passed via include files are

                    library including many processes at once. Useful for interfacing MadLoop to other MC's
                    and already working with Sherpa.

                OM: Update SysCalc to:
                      - Fix a bug that some file where sometimes truncated.
                      - Allow for independant scale variation for the factorization/renormalization scale.
                RF+OM: Improve the handling of conflicting Breit-Wigners at NLO
		RF: Print the scale and PDF uncertainties for fNLO runs in the summary at the end of the run

2.1.0(21/02/14) MADWEIGHT RELEASE:
                ------------------
                
                OM+PA: First Official release of MadWeight inside MG5_aMC
                      Main update:
                        - ISR corrections
                        - possibility to use narrow-width approximation
                        - introducing a module for the pre-selection of the parton-jet assignment.
                        - extended formalism for the transfer function (more generic)
                        - possibility to evaluate the weights for multiple choices of transfer function 
      			  on the same phase-space point. The phase-space is optimized for the first set of 
                          parameters.
		      Speed update:
                        - More efficient way to group the computation for identical process with different final state.
                        - Possibility to Monte-Carlo over the permutation.
                        - More efficient way to choose between the various change of variable.
                        - Possibility to use mint (not compatible with all of the options)
			- Possibility to use sobol for the generation of PS point (sometimes faster than pure 
                          random point generator.

                MadEvent/aMC@NLO UPDATE/BUG FIXING:
 		-----------------------------------

                OM: Fix critical bug (returns wrong cross-section/width) for processes where the center of mass 
                    energy of the beam is lower than 1 GeV. So this has no impact for LHC-collider phenomenology.
                    This can also impact computation of decay-width if the mass of that particle is below 1 GeV.
		RF: Critical bug fixed (introduced in 2.0.2) for fixed order NLO runs that could
		    give the wrong cross section when the phase-space generation is inefficient
                    (like in the case for conflicting Breit-Wigners). This bug did not affect runs
                    with matching to the parton shower.
                OM: Fix a bug leading to a crash with some decay syntax. i.e., p p > t t~, (t > w+ b), (t~ >w- b~)
                OM: Fix format of LHE output for 1>N events when the <init> and mother information were wrongly set 
                    to LHC default. Specific support of this option will be part of pythia8 (8.185 and later)
                OM: Fix the syntax for the custom propagator to follow the description of arXiv:1308.1668 
                OM: Allow to call ASperGe on the flight if ASperGe module is include in the UFO model.
                    just type "asperge" at the moment where the code propose you to edit the param_card.

                MADSPIN UPDATE:
                ---------------
                OM: Allow to use another model for the decay than the one used for the production of events.
                    You are responsible of the consistency of the model in that case.
                PA: Include hellicity information for the events generated by MadSpin.
                OM: Fix a bug in MadSpin preventing the gridpack to run with NLO processes.

2.0.2(07/02/14) RF: Suppressed the writing of the 'ERROR in OneLOop dilog2_r' messages (introduced in the 
                    previous version)
                OM: Fix the bug that the shower_card.dat was wrongly identified as a pythia_card.
                OM: add one MadSpin option allowing to control the number of simultaneous open files.
                OM: Fix a bug in eps preventing evince preventing label to be displayed on page 2 and following
                    Thanks to Gauthier Durieux for the fix.
                OM: Fix a bug(crash) for p p > w+ w- j j introduce in 2.0.0 due to some jet sometimes tagged as QCD
                    and sometimes not (which was making the automatic scale computation to crash)
                OM: Change the way to writte the <init> line of the lhe file to take into account
                    - process with more that 100 subprocesses (note that you need to hack the pythia-pgs
                      package to deal with such large number of sub-process
                    - deal with pdf identification number bigger than 1 million.  
                OM: Fixed a bug preventing the Madevent to detect external module (pythia-pgs, syscalc,...)
                    Bug #1271216 (thanks Iwamoto)
                PT: PYTHIA8 scale and pdf variations

2.0.1(20/01/14) OM: Fix a bug in h > l+ l- l+ l- for group_subproceses =False (decay only). A follow up of 
                    the bug fix in 2.0.0
                RF: Replaced the Error#10 in the generation of the phase-space (for NLO) to a Warning#10.
                    In rare cases this error stopped the code, while this was not needed.
                RF: When using non-optimized loop output, the code now also works fine.
                OM: Modification of the code to allow the code to run on our servers
                VH: Improve the timing routine of the NLO code (displayed in debug mode)
                VH: FIX the import of old UFO model (those without the all_orders attribute).
                OM: Add a functionalities for restrict_model if a file paramcard_RESTRICTNAME.dat
                    exists, then this file is use as default param_card for that restriction.
                HS: Updated CutTools to v1.9.2

2.0.0(14/12/13)    CHANGE IN DEFAULT:
                   ------------------
                      OM: Change the Higgs mass to 125 GeV for most of the model (but the susy/v4 one).
                      OM: Change the default energy of collision to 13 TeV.
                      RF: Default renormalisation and factorisation scales are now set to H_T/2. (for aMC only)

                   MadEvent Update:
                   ----------------
                      OM+SF+RF: Add Frixione Photon isolation (also for aMC)
                      OM: Implementation of the reweight module for Leading Order matrix-element
                      JA+OM+AK: Store parameters needed for systematics studies.
                          This can be turned on with the use_syst parameter in
                          run_card.dat.
                          This output can be used to generate event weights for
                          a variety of variational parameters, including scalefact,
                          alpsfact, PDF choice, and matching scale. Note that this require
                          pythia-pgs v2.2 for matching scale.
                      OM+JA+Chia: Implement MadWidth (automatic/smart computation of the widths)
                      OM: Support for Form-Factor defined in the UFO model. and support for model
                          parameter presence inside the Lorentz expression.
                      OM: Support for a arbitrary functions.f file present inside the UFO model. 
                      JA: Included <clustering> tag in matched .lhe output, to be 
                          used together with Pythia 8 CKKW-L matching. This can be 
                          turned off with the clusinfo flag in run_card.dat.
                      JA: New treatment of matching for diagrams that have no
                          corresponding lower-multiplicity diagrams. Jets that
                          are not classified as shower-type emission jets are
                          flagged in the cluster scale info at the end of the event,
                          which is recognized by the Pythia interface in Pythia-PGS
                          package v. 2.2. For such jets, xqcut does not apply. This
                          allows for consistent matching e.g. of p p > w+ b b~ in 
                          the 4-flavor scheme. Note that auto_ptj_mjj must be set to
                          .false. for this to work properly.
                      OM: Change model restriction behavior: two widths with identical are not merged anymore.
                      S.Prestel(via OM): implement KT Durham cut. (thanks to Z. Marshall)
                      OM: Improved check for unresponsive of PBS cluster (thanks J. Mc Fayden)
                      OM: Implement a maximum number (2500) of jobs which can be submitted at the same time
                          by the PBS cluster. This number is currently not editable via configuration file.
                     
                   MadEvent Bug Fixing:
                   --------------------
                      OM: Fix a bug for h > l+ l- l+ l- (introduce in 1.5.9) where the phase-space parametrization 
                          fails to cover the full phase-space. This bugs occurs only if two identical particles decays
                          in identical particles and if both of those particles can't be on-shell simultaneously. 
                      OM: Fix a bug for multi_run sample in presence of negative weights (possible if NLO pdf)
                          The negative weights were not propagated to the merged sample. 
                          (thanks to Sebastien Brochet for the fix)
	         
                   aMC@NLO Update:       ! FIRST OFFICIAL RELEASE WITH NLO CAPABILITIES !
                   ---------------

                       RF: Use MC over helicities for the MadLoop virtual corrections.
                       RF: Using "virtual tricks" to reduce the number of PS points for which to include
                           the virtual corrections, leading to a speed up of the code.
                       OM+SF+RF: Add Frixione Photon isolation (also in MadEvent)
                       PA+OM: Fast version of MadSpin implemented (PS generation in Fortran).
		       OM: Allow to have MadSpin in "gridpack mode" (same cards/same decay). 
                           Add in the madspin_card "set ms_dir PATH". If the path didn't exist MS will
                           create the gridpack on that path, otherwise it will reuse the information 
                           (diagram generated, maximum weight of each channel, branching ratio,...)
                           This allow to bypass all the initialization steps BUT is valid only for the 
                           exact same event generation.
                       VH: Fixed set_run.f which incorrectly sets a default value for ptl, drll and
                           etal making the code insensitive to the values set in the run_card.dat 
                       VH: Fixed a bug in MadLoop that doubled the computing time for quad precision
                       VH+RF: Added MadLoop stability information to the log files (and run summary
                           in DEBUG mode).
                       RF: Fixed a stability problem in the reweighting to get PDF and scale uncertainties.
                       VH+RF: Improved the Binoth LHA interface
                       RF: Improved the multi-channeling for processes with more amplitudes than diagrams.
                       RF: Added a new parameter in the run_card to set the required accuracy for fixed 
                           order runs.
                       SF+RF: Improved handling of fixed order analysis

                           friendly way.
                       RF: Event normalization is now Les Houches compliant (the weights
		           of the events should average to the total rate). The old normalization
                           can still be chosen by setting the flag 'sum = event_norm' in the run_card.
		       RF: Fixes a bug related to the mass of the tau that was not consistently 
 		           taking into account in the phase-space set-up.
		       VH: Fixed the incorrect implementation of the four gluons R2 in the loop_sm UFO.
		       VH: Fixed the UV renormalization for the SM with massive c quarks.
                       RF: The PDF uncertainty for NNPDF is now also correctly given in the run summary
                       RF: Some improvements in the test_MC and test_ME when matrix elements are
                           numerically very large
                       OM+RF: Added the running at LO to the 'launch questions'
                       OM: Allow "check" command to use a event file.
                           This will use the related param_card and the first
                           event compatible with the requested process.
                       RF: Improved the phase-space generation in the case of competing resonances

                       VH: Fix computation in the Feynman gauge for the loops
                       RF: automatic computation of the NLO uncertainties
                       OM: NLO can now be runned with no central disk
                       MZ: change the format of number (using e and not d)
                       MZ: compilation and tests are possible in multicore
                       RF: allow to precise either uncertainty or number of events
                           for aMC@NLO/NLO
                       OM: ./bin/mg5 cmd.cmd is now working for NLO process

                    From beta1 (31/10/12):
                       aMCatNLO Team: First public (beta) version of aMCatNLO.

                  OM: Add a command print_results in the madevent interface. This command print the 
                      cross-section/number of events/... 
                  OM: change the way prompt color is handle (no systematic reset). Which provides better

                      one W decaying leptonically. For such processes the lepton cuts were also used
                      on the neutrino particle reducing the cross-section. This bug was present only

                  OM: Aloha modifications: faster to create routines and more 
                      optimized routines (up to 40% faster than previous version).

                  JA: Ensure identical results for identical seeds also with
                      multiple runs in the same directory. Note that identical runs
                      with previous versions can't be guaranteed (but different
                      seeds are guaranteed to give statistically independent runs).

                      This is done fully automatically for condor cluster.
                      For the other clusters, the user should set the variable
                      "cluster_temp_path" pointing to a directory (usefull only if 
                      the directory is on the node filesystem). This still requires
                      access to central disk for copying, event combination,

                       when the user press Ctrl-C during the job.

1.4.8 (24/07/12)  JA: Cancel running of integration channels where the BW
                      structure makes it impossible to get any events. This
                      can significantly speed up event generation for processes
                      with conflicting BWs.
                  JA: Minor modification of integration grid presetting in
                      myamp.f, due to the above point.
                  JA: Raise exception if a decay process has decaying particles
                      that are not present in the corresponding core process
                      (this might help avoid syntax mistakes).

                      when different process flags @N are given to different
                      decays of the same core process (sorry, this was missed
                      in v. 1.4.7).
                  JA: Fixed crash for process p p > w+ w+ j j t t~ when all 
                      w and t/t~ are decayed (bug #1017912, thanks to Nicolas

                  JA: Fixed crash for identical decay chains for particle-anti- 
                      particle when only one of the two is decayed, introduced 
                      in v. 1.4.7 (thanks John Lee).
                  OM: Ensure that matching plots are replaced correctly when

1.4.7 (25/06/12)  JA: Change the random seed treatment to ensure that the original 
                      seed is stored in the banner (this was broken in v. 1.4.0).
                      If a non-zero seed is given in the run_card, this seed
                      is used as starting value for the SubProcesses/randinit file,
                      while the seed in the run_card is set to 0.
                      This way, the seed for a multi_run is automatically
                      updated in the same way as for individual runs.

                      non-identical matrix elements to be combined in certain
                      complicated processes (such as p p > l vl l vl l vl),
                      resulting in lines with Z > e+ mu- in the event file

                      (thanks Nicolas Deutschmann for reporting).          
                  JA: Make sure that also the SubProcesses directories are 
                      cleaned when running bin/compile in a gridpack.
                  JA: Removed the confusing makefile in Template and replace it

                     in the html files.
                  OM: Changed the way the stdout/stderr are treated on the cluster

                      p p > t t~ + jets with decays of t and t~.
                  JA: Added GE cluster to the list in cluster.py.
                  JA: Allow up to 1M events in a single run. Note that the 
                      unweighting (combine events) step gets quite slow with
                      so many events. Also note that if Pythia is run, still
                      maximum 50k events is recommended in a single run. 
                  OM: Fix problem linked to filesystem which makes new files

                      (introduced in v. 1.4.3).

1.4.3 (08/03/12)  JA: Reintroduced the possibility to completely forbid
                      s-channel diagrams, using the $$ notation. Note that
                      this should be used with great care, since the result
                      is in general not gauge-invariant. It is in general
                      better to use the $ notation, forbidding only onshell
                      s-channel particles (the inverse of decay chains).
                  JA: Automatically ensure that ptj and mmjj are below xqcut

                  OM: ALOHA modifications:
                       - Change sign convention for Epsilon (matching FR choices)
                       - For Fermion vertex forces that _1 always returns the  
                         incoming fermion and _2 returns the outcoming fermion. 
                         (This modifies conjugate routine output)
                       - Change the order of argument for conjugate routine
                         to expect IO order of fermion in all cases.
                       Note that the two last modifications matches MG5 conventions
                       and that those modifications correct bugs for interactions
                       a) subject to conjugate routine (i.e. if the model has 
                          majorana)                       
                       b) containing fermion momentum dependencies in the Lorentz
                          structure  
                       All model included by default in MG5 (in particular sm/mssm)
                       were not affected by those mismatch of conventions.

                 OM: For MSSM model, convert param_card to SLAH1. This card is
                      converted to SLAH2 during the MadEvent run since the UFO 
                      model uses SLAH2. This allows to use Pythia 6,
                      as well as having a coherent definition for the flavor.
                 JA+OM: For decay width computations, the launch command in 
                      addition to compute the width, creates a new param_card 
                      with the width set to the associated values, and with the 
                      Branching ratio associated (usefull for pythia). 
                 NOTE: This param_card makes sense for future run ONLY if all 
                      relevant decay are generated.
                 EXAMPLE: (after launch bin/mg5):
                       import model sm-full
                       generate t > b w+

                 OM: change output pythia8 syntax: If a path is specified this 
                      is considered as the output directory.
                 OM: Change the path of the madevent output files. This allows 
                      to run pythia/pgs/delphes mulitple times for the same set 
                      of events (with different pythia/... parameters).
                 OM: Madevent output is now insensitive to the relative path
                      to pythia-pgs, delphes, ... In consequence you don't need
                      anymore to have your directory at the same level as 
                      Template directory. 
                 OM: MadEvent checks that the param_card is coherent with the 
                      restriction used during the model generation. 
                 OM: Model restrictions will now also force opposite number to 
                      match (helpfull for constraining to rotation matrix).  
                 OM: Change the import command. It's now allowed to omit the 
                      type of import. The type is guessed automaticaly. 
                      This is NOT allowed on the web.

                      Lorentz structure associates to the vertex.
                 OM: Add a check that the color representation is coherent.

                      be used, either via the configuration file or via the set 
                      command.
                 OM: Add the possibility to bypass the automatic opening of 
                      the web browser (via the configuration file:

                 OM: Add options for the display command:
                      a) display options: return the current option value. 
                        i.e. those set via the set command and/or via the 
                        configuration file
                      b) display variable NAME: return the current string 
                        representation of NAME and/or self.NAME .

                 OM: New Python script for the creation of the various html pages.
                      This Requires less disk access for the generation of the files.

                 OM: Improve cluster support. MadEvent now supports PBS/Condor/SGE
                      Thanks to Arian Abrahantes for the SGE implementation.
                 OM: Improve auto-completion (better output/dealing with multi line/...)
                 OM: Improve the parallel suite and change the release script to run
                      some of the parallel tests. This ensures even higher stability 
                      of the  code for the future releases.
                 JA: Changed the way gridpacks work: Set granularity to 1
                      (so randomly select channels only if they should generate 
                      less than 1 event), but allowing channels to run down to a single
                      iteration. This removes all old problems with increased
                      variance for small channels in the gridpacks, while giving 
                      even faster event generation.

                 Thanks to Johan Alwall, Sho Iwamoto for all the important 
                 testing/bug reports.


1.3.33 (01/01/12) JA: Revisited colors for propagators in addmothers.f
                      to ensure that propagators in color flow
                      violating processes get the correct color
                      from initial state particles (thanks to
                      Michele Gabusi for forcing me to do this).

1.3.32 (21/12/11) JA: Fixed a bug in the PDF reweighting routine,
                      which caused skewed eta distributions for

                      two different Majorana particles depends on the
                      incoming/outgoing status of the Majorana particles
                      (needed for MSSM with Goldstino).
                  JA: Fixed problem with colors in addmothers.f for complicated
                      multiparticle vertices and simplified color treatment

                  OM: Include some parallel test in the release script.


1.3.27 (05/11/11) JA: Fix bug in mirrored amplitudes (sometimes
                      amplitudes that should not be flagged as
                      mirrored were flagged as mirrored). Thanks
                      Marco Zaro for reporting this!
                  JA: Fix another problem getting enough events in
                      gridpack mode (it was not completely fixed in
                      v. 1.3.24). Thanks Alexis!
                  JA: Added "!" comments for all parameters in the default
                      run_card, since apparently this is still needed
                      for g77 to correctly read the parameters.
 
1.3.26 (31/10/11) JA: Fix color setting in MadEvent event file for
                      multiparticle vertices, which was not taken into

                      have resonances with identical properties.

                      after the output command. 

1.3.24 (22/10/11) JA: Fix problem with getting enough events in gridpack
                      mode (this was broken in v. 1.3.11 when we moved
                      from events to luminocity in refine). Thanks to
                      Alexis Kalogeropoulos.

1.3.23 (19/10/11) JA: Allow user to set scales using setscales.f again 
                      (this was broken in v. 1.3.18). Thanks to Arindam Das.
                  JA: Ensure that the error message is displayed if the
                     "make" command is not installed on the system.
 
1.3.22 (12/10/11) JA: Fixed another bug (also introduced in 1.3.18), which 
                      could give the wrong ordering between the s-channel 
                      propagators for certain multiprocess cases (this
                      also lead to a hard stop, so don't worry, if you get 
                      your events, the bug doesn't affect you). Sorry about
                      that, this is what happens when you add a lot of
                      new functionality...

1.3.21 (12/10/11) OM: Add a new command: install.
                      This allow to install quite easily different package
                      devellop for Madgraph/MadEvent. The list of available
                      package are pythia-pgs/MadAnalysis/ExRootAnalysis/Delphes

                      introduced in 1.3.18.

1.3.20 (09/10/11) JA: Fixed bug in myamp.f that created a hard stop
                      error for certain cases with many processes with
                      different propagators in the same subprocess dir.

1.3.19 (06/10/11) JA: Fixed problem with SubProcesses makefile on Linux,
                      introduced in 1.3.18.

1.3.18 (04/10/11) JA: Use model information to determine color of particles
                      for reweighting and propagator color info.
                  JA: Changed the definition of "forbidden s-channels"
                      denoted by "$" to exclude on-shell s-channels while
                      keeping all diagrams (i.e., complemetary to the decay
                      chain formalism). This reduces the problems with 
                      gauge invariance compared to previously.
                      "Onshell" is as usual defined by the "bwcutoff" flag 
                      in the run_card.dat.
                  JA: Enable proper 4-flavor matching (such as gg>hbb~+jets)
                      Note that you need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.9 or 
                      later to use with 4F matching.
                      Changes include: alpha_s reweighting also for b vertices,
                      new scale treatment (mu_F for pp>hbb~ is (pT_b^max*m_Th)),
                      no clustering of gluons to final-state massive particles
                      in MadEvent.
                  JA: Ensure that factorization scale settings and matching works
                      also in singlet t-channel exchange processes like
                      single top and VBF. The dynamic factorization
                      scale is given by the pT of the scattered quark
                      (on each side of the event).
                Note: You need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.10 or later
                      to use with VBF matching, to ensure that both radiated
                      and scattered partons are treated correctly
                      - scattered partons need to be excluded from the matching,
                      since their pT can be below QCUT. An even better
                      treatment would require to individually shower and match
                      the two sides in Pythia, which is not presently possible.
                Note: In the matched 4-flavor process p p > t b~ j $ w+ w- t~ +
                      p p > t b~ j j $ w+ w- t~, there is an admixture
                      of t-channel single top (with up to 1 radiated jet) 
                      and s-channel single top (with up to 2 radiated jets). 
                      In this case, the automatic determination of maximum 
                      multiplicity sample doesn't work (since max in the file 
                      will be 2 jets, but for t-channel max is 1 jet).
                      So MAXJETS=1 must be specified in the pythia_card.dat.
                  JA: Fixed pdf reweighting for matching, which due to a mistake
                      had never been activated.
                  JA: Improved phase space integration presetting further by 
                      taking into account special cuts like xpt, ht etc.
                  JA: Introduce new convention for invariant mass cuts
                      - if max < min, exclude intermediate range
                      (allows to exclude W/Z dijet resonances in VBF processes)

1.3.17 (30/09/11) OM: Fix a crash created by ALOHA when it tries to create the full
                      set of ALOHA routines (pythia8 output only).

1.3.16 (11/09/11) JA: Fixed the problem from 1.3.12.

1.3.15 (09/09/11) OM: remove the fix of 1.3.12
                      (No events in output for some given processes)

1.3.14 (08/09/11) OM: Fix a bug in the RS model introduced in 1.3.8

1.3.13 (05/09/11) JA: Fixed bug with cut_decays=F which removed cuts also for
                      non-decay products in certain channels if there is
                      a forced decay present. Note that this does not affect
                      xqcut, only pt, minv and eta cuts.
                  JA: If non-zero phase space cutoff, don't use minimum of
                      1 GeV (this allows to go to e.g. 2m_e invariant mass for
                      \gamma* > e+ e-).

1.3.12 (01/09/11) JA: Fixed problem with decay chains when different decays
                      result in identical final states, such as
                      p p > go go, (go > b1/b1~ b/b~, b1/b1~ > b/b~ n1)
                      (only one of the decay chains was chosen, instead of
                      all 3 combinations (b1,b1), (b1,b1~), (b1~,b1~))
                  JA: Allow for overall orders also with grouped subprocesses
                  JA: Ensure that only leading color flows are included in event
                      output (so no singlet flows from color octets).
                  JA: Fixed small bug in fermion flow determination for multifermion

1.3.11 (26/08/11) JA: Improved precision of "survey" by allowing 4th and 5th 
                      iteration if accuracy after 3 iterations < 10%.
                  JA: Subdivide BW in phase space integration for conflicting BWs 
                      also for forced decays, to improve generation with large
