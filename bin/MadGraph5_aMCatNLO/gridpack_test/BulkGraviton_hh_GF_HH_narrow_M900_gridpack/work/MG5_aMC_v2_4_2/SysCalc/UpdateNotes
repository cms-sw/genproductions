Change in the code 

1.1.6: 30/01/16: OM: Allow to have photon in the initial state
                 OM: Slightly change to the output format (fix a problem of convention with lhef v3) 
                     and add additional tag in the definition of the weights
                 OM: Fix a bug associated to the PDF reweighting factor making the code to return nan

1.1.5: 05/09/15: AK+OM: Fixed a bug introduced in 1.1.4 that caused the pdf for beam0 not to the initialized properly 
		          resulted in not having the pdf weighting properly done
1.1.4: 03/08/15: OM: Fix the code for e+ e- collision
                 OM: Fix the code when more than 10 particle in the final state (thanks to B. Maier)

1.1.3: 12/03/15: OM: Fix the log output such that the information of QCUT are reported correctly.

1.1.2: 06/03/15: OM: Improve makefile for easier compilation of the code (based on lhapdf-config)

1.1.1: 12/01/15: OM: Fix a problem in the cross-section reported in presence of multiple pdf set.
                     The weight associate to the event were correct but not the associate cross-section.

1.1.0: 13/03/14: OM: Allow for independant (and choosing how to correlate the factorization/renormalization scale.
                 OM: Fix a bug which was making sometimes the file to be fully written on disk (Thanks Markus Ebert)
                 OM: the event number written are now those corresponding to the order in the LHE file.
                     The correspondance with pythia output is clear since they are written sequentially.
               
1.0.1: 22/02/14: OM: Correct a bug in the weight to write the weight event by event
                     Thanks Markus Ebert for finding it.
