Update notes for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (in reverse time order)

2.4.2 (10/06/16)
        OM: fix a compilation problem for non standard gfortran system
        OM: reduce the need of lhapdf for standard LO run. (was making some run to test due to missing dependencies)

2.4.1 (10/06/16)
        OM: Fix a bug in fix target experiment with PDF on the particle at rest.
            The cross-section was correct but the z-boost was not performed correctly.
        OM: Fix various bug in MadSpin
        OM: Fix some bug in MLM merging, where chcluster was forced to True (introduced in 2.2.0)
        OM: Allow to specify a path for a custom directory where to look for model via the environment 
            variable PYTHONPATH. Note this used AFTER the standard ./models directory

2.4.0 (12/05/16)
        OM: Allowing the proper NLO reweighting for NLO sample
	RF: For NLO processes allow for multiple PDF and scales reweighting, directy by inputting lists
	    in the run_card.dat.
        VH: Interfaced MadLoop to Samurai and Ninja (the latter is now the default)
        HS: Turn IREGI to off by default
        MZ: new NLO generation mode. It is more efficient from the memory and CPU point of 
            view, in particular for high-multiplicity processes. 
            Many thanks to Josh Bendavid for his fundamental contribution for this.
            The mode can be enabled with
            > set low_mem_multicore_nlo_generation True
            before generating the process.
        OM: Adding the possibility to use new syntax for tree-level processes:
            QED==2 and QCD>2: The first allows to select exactly a power of the coupling (at amplitude level
            While the second ask for a minimum value.   
        RF: In the PDF uncertainty for fixed-order NLO runs, variations of alphaS were not included.
        OM: In MLM matching, fix a bug where the alpha_s reweighting was not fully applied on some events. 
            (This was leading to effects smaller than the theoretical uncertainty)
        OM: Fixing the problem of using lhapdf6 on Mac
        MZ: Faster interface for LHAPDF6
        OM: Add support of epsilon_ijk in MadSpin

        OM: Allow to keep the reweight information in the final lhe file for future computation 
        MZ: updated FJcore to version 3.1.3 (was 3.0.5)

        To perform a scan on this parameter.
    OM: Having two mode for "output pythia8" one (default) for pythia8.2 and one for pythia8.1 (with --version=8.1)
    OM: Allow new syntax for the param_card: instead of an entry you can enter "scan:[val1, val2,...]"
        To perform a scan on this parameter.
    OM: Having two mode for "output pythia8" one (default) for pythia8.2 and one for pythia8.1 (with --version=8.1)
	RF: Rewriting of job-control for NLO processes. Better accuracy estimates for FO processes
	RF: Fix for factorisation scale setting in FxFx merging when very large difference in scale in the
 	    non-QCD part of a process. 
	RF: Better discarding of numerical instabilities in the real-emission matrix elements. Only of interested for
	    processes which have jets at Born level, but do not require generation cut (like t-channel single-top). 
	RF: Added an option to the run_card to allow for easier variation of the shower starting scale (NLO only).
	RF: Fixed a problem in the setting of the flavour map used for runs with iAPPL >= 1. 
	RF: Allow for decay processes to compute (partial) decay widths at NLO accuracy (fixed order only).
    OM: (SysCalc interface) Allow to bypass the pdf reweighting/alpsfact reweighting
    MZ: fixed bug related to slurm clusters
	OM: remove the addmasses.py script of running by default on gridpack mode. 
            if you want to have it running, you just have to rename the file madevent/bin/internal/addmasses_optional.py to
 	    madevent/bin/internal/addmasses_optional.py and it will work as before. (Do not work with SysCalc tag)
        OM: make the code compatible with "python -tt" option

2.3.2.2 (06/09/15)
    VH: Finalized the MG5aMC-GoSam interface

2.3.2(20/08/15)   
        OM: Improve reweighting module. (https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/Reweight)
            New Capabilities: 
             - allow to reweight by loop-induced processes
             - allow to change model 
             - allow to change process definition
             - allow to unweight the sample to have an idea of the statistical power.
             - allow to perform some crude reweighting on NLO sample (reweighting by LO matrix element). NLO
               accuracy is not preserved (in general) for such computation.
            New dependencies:
	     - require the f2py module (part of numpy)
	OM: change the kt-durham cut (at LO) such that particle comming from decay are not impacted if cut_decays
            is on False.
        VH: Fixed the check in helas wavefunction appearance order in an helas diagrams. It failed in cases
	    where additional wf were created during the fix of fermion flow in presence of majorana fermions.         
	RF: Fixed a bug in the aMCFast/ApplGrid interfaced introduced in the previous version.
        OM: Fix a crash when using mssm-no_b_mass model (due to the SLHA1-SLHA2 conversion)
        OM: Fix a bug in the add_time_of_flight function (not called by default) where the displaced vertex information
            was written in second and not in mm as it should. Note that this function can now be run on the flight
	    by adding the following line in the run_card: "  1e-2 = time_of_flight #threshold for the displaced vertex" 
	RF: Small fix that leads to an improvement in the phase-space generation for NLO processes
        OM: Fix a crash introduce in 2.3.0 when running sequentially in the same directory (thanks Gauthier)

            NNPDF (like for the old cteq_6m, etc).
	RF: Fixed a bug in the PDF combination in the HwU histograms: there was no consistent use if Hessian
            and Gaussian approaches for MSTW/CTEQ and NNPDF, respectively.
        OM: Fixed a small bug in EWdim6 which was removing a coupling in AZHH interaction.
        OM: improve customize_model function to avoid problem with unity coupling.

     OM+VH: Automation of event generation for loop-induced processes.
		OM: Automatic change of the p/j definition to include the b particle if the model has a massless b.

                OM+VH: Change the handling of the run_card.
                      - The default value depends now of your running process
                      - cut_decays is now on False by default
                      - nhel can only take 0/1 value. 1 is a real MC over helicity (with importance sampling)
                      - use_syst is set on by default (but for matching where it is keep off)                    
                      - New options added: dynamical_scale_choice, it can take the following value
		            -1 : MadGraph5_aMC@NLO default (different for LO/NLO/ ickkw mode) same as previous version. 
                             0 : Tag reserved for user define dynamical scale (need to be added in setscales.f).
                             1 : Total transverse energy of the event.
                             2 : sum of the transverse mass 
                             3 : sum of the transverse mass divide by 2 
			     4 : \sqrt(s), partonic energy 
                OM: Cuts are also applied for 1>N processes (but the default run_card doesn't have any cut).         
                PT: Set command available for shower_card parameters
                OM: New MultiCore class with better thread support

		RF+VH: Replaced the default topdrawer histograms with HwU histograms for f(N)LO runs
                    and allow it also for aMC@NLO runs.

                    add an option --format=short allowing to print the result in a multi-column format
                OM: Possibility to not transfer pdf file to the node for each job. 
                       This is done via a new option (cluster_local_path) which should contain the pdf set.
                       This path is intented to point to a node specific filesystem.
                    New way to submit job on cluster without writting the command file on the disk.
                OM: Allowing MadSpin to have a mode without full spin-correlation but handling three (and more) 
                    body decay. (set spinmode=none).

                OM: Fix a bug in MadWeight (correlated param_card was not creating the correct input file)
		RF: When requiring more than 1M events for (N)LO+PS runs, do not go to higher precision than 0.001
                    for the grids and cross section (can be overwritten with the req_acc run_card parameter).
		RF: Make sure that reweight info (for PDF and scale uncertainties) also works for UNLOPS events.
		RF: When setting the B's stable in the shower_card, also set the eta_b (PDG=551) stable.
		OM: Change the Breit-Wigner splitting for the multi-channel integration, use the bwcutoff instead of
                    the hardcoded value 5.
                MZ: Fix to bug 1406000 (segfault appearing when doing FxFx merging). Thanks to Josh Bendavid for
                    having reported it
                MZ: Fix to a bug occurring when generating event in the "split" mode: the required output was 
                    not correctly specified
                OM: The built-in pdf "nn23lo" and "nn23lo1" where associate to the wrong lhapdfid in the lhef file

                OM: Fix a bug in the LO re-weighing  module which was removing the 
                    SysCalc weight from the lhe file (thanks Shin-Shan)
                Team: Fixes to different small bugs / improvement in the error and warning messages
		RF: For aMC runs, If a NAN is found, the code now skips that PS point and continues instead of
		    leading to NAN.
                RF: For fNLO runs the virtuals were included twice in the setting of the integration grids. 
                    This was not leading to any bias in previous version of the code.

2.2.2(06/11/14) OM: Correct a bug in the integration grid (introduces in 2.1.2). This was biasing the cross-section of 
                    processes like a a > mu+ mu- in the Effective Photon Approximation by three order of magnitude.
                    For LHC processes no sizeable effect have been observe so far.
                MZ: some informations for aMC@NLO runs which were before passed via include files are
                    now read at runtime. The size of executables as well as compilation time / memory usage
                    is reduced for complicated processes
                RF: Fix crash #1377187 (check that cuts were consistent with the grouping was too restrictive) 
		RF: For NLO running: added 'strip' to the makefiles to reduce executable sizes (removes symbol info)
		Stefano Carrazza (by RF): fix for the photon PDF for the internal NNPDF sets
		RF: Improved the check on the consistency of the cuts and the grouping of subprocesse (LO running)

                    and interfaced to MadLoop's output.
                VH: Re-structuring of MadLoop's standalone output so as to easily create a single dynamic 
                    library including many processes at once. Useful for interfacing MadLoop to other MC's
                    and already working with Sherpa.
                VH+HS: This branch contains all the fixes for proper treatment of the latest BSM@NLO models 
                    produced by FeynRules@NLO. In particular, the fixed related to the presence of majorana 
                    particles in loop ME's.

                OM: MadEvent output is now LHEFv3 fully compliant. A parameter in the run_tag (lhe_version) 
                    allows to return LHEF version 2 format for retro-compatibility.

2.1.1(31/03/14) OM: Change the way the UFO model is handle by adding a prefix (mdl_) to all model variable.
                    This avoid any potential name conflict with other part of the code. This feature can be
                    bypassed by using the option --noprefix when importing the model.
                OM: New command "add model XXX" supported. This command creates a new UFO model from two UFO model.
                    The main interest stand in the command "add model hgg_plugin", which add the effective operator
                    h g g to the original UFO model. The model is written on disk for edition/future reference.
		RF: Reduced the calls to fastjet and skipped the computation of the reweight coeffients when
 		    they are not needed.
                OM: Fixed a bug for LO processes where the MMLL cut was not applied to the event sample.
                PA: Fix a bug in MadSpin to avoid numerical instabitities when extracting t-channel invariants
                    from the production event file (see modification in driver.f, search for 'MODIF March 5, 2014') 
                OM: Better determination of which particles are in representation 3/3bar since FR is ambiguous on that point.
                    Now the determination also looks for 3 -3 1 interactions to check if that help.
                OM: Fix a bug(crash) in MW linked to the permutation pre-selection module.
		RF: Better comments in the code for user-defined cuts in the ./SubProcesses/cuts.f function.
                    Also the maxjetflavor parameter in the run_card is now actually working.
                OM: Update SysCalc to:
                      - Fix a bug that some file where sometimes truncated.
                      - Allow for independant scale variation for the factorization/renormalization scale.
                RF+OM: Improve the handling of conflicting Breit-Wigners at NLO
		RF: Print the scale and PDF uncertainties for fNLO runs in the summary at the end of the run

2.1.0(21/02/14) MADWEIGHT RELEASE:
                ------------------
                
                OM+PA: First Official release of MadWeight inside MG5_aMC
                      Main update:
                        - ISR corrections
                        - possibility to use narrow-width approximation
                        - introducing a module for the pre-selection of the parton-jet assignment.
                        - extended formalism for the transfer function (more generic)
                        - possibility to evaluate the weights for multiple choices of transfer function 
      			  on the same phase-space point. The phase-space is optimized for the first set of 
                          parameters.
		      Speed update:
                        - More efficient way to group the computation for identical process with different final state.
                        - Possibility to Monte-Carlo over the permutation.
                        - More efficient way to choose between the various change of variable.
                        - Possibility to use mint (not compatible with all of the options)
			- Possibility to use sobol for the generation of PS point (sometimes faster than pure 
                          random point generator.

                MadEvent/aMC@NLO UPDATE/BUG FIXING:
 		-----------------------------------

                OM: Fix critical bug (returns wrong cross-section/width) for processes where the center of mass 
                    energy of the beam is lower than 1 GeV. So this has no impact for LHC-collider phenomenology.
                    This can also impact computation of decay-width if the mass of that particle is below 1 GeV.
		RF: Critical bug fixed (introduced in 2.0.2) for fixed order NLO runs that could
		    give the wrong cross section when the phase-space generation is inefficient
                    (like in the case for conflicting Breit-Wigners). This bug did not affect runs
                    with matching to the parton shower.
                OM: Fix a bug leading to a crash with some decay syntax. i.e., p p > t t~, (t > w+ b), (t~ >w- b~)
                OM: Fix format of LHE output for 1>N events when the <init> and mother information were wrongly set 
                    to LHC default. Specific support of this option will be part of pythia8 (8.185 and later)
                OM: Fix the syntax for the custom propagator to follow the description of arXiv:1308.1668 
                OM: Allow to call ASperGe on the flight if ASperGe module is include in the UFO model.
                    just type "asperge" at the moment where the code propose you to edit the param_card.

                MADSPIN UPDATE:
                ---------------
                OM: Allow to use another model for the decay than the one used for the production of events.
                    You are responsible of the consistency of the model in that case.
                PA: Include hellicity information for the events generated by MadSpin.
                OM: Fix a bug in MadSpin preventing the gridpack to run with NLO processes.

2.0.2(07/02/14) RF: Suppressed the writing of the 'ERROR in OneLOop dilog2_r' messages (introduced in the 
                    previous version)
                OM: Fix the bug that the shower_card.dat was wrongly identified as a pythia_card.
                OM: add one MadSpin option allowing to control the number of simultaneous open files.
                OM: Fix a bug in eps preventing evince preventing label to be displayed on page 2 and following
                    Thanks to Gauthier Durieux for the fix.
                OM: Fix a bug(crash) for p p > w+ w- j j introduce in 2.0.0 due to some jet sometimes tagged as QCD
                    and sometimes not (which was making the automatic scale computation to crash)
                OM: Change the way to writte the <init> line of the lhe file to take into account
                    - process with more that 100 subprocesses (note that you need to hack the pythia-pgs
                      package to deal with such large number of sub-process
                    - deal with pdf identification number bigger than 1 million.  
                OM: Fixed a bug preventing the Madevent to detect external module (pythia-pgs, syscalc,...)
                    Bug #1271216 (thanks Iwamoto)
                PT: PYTHIA8 scale and pdf variations

2.0.1(20/01/14) OM: Fix a bug in h > l+ l- l+ l- for group_subproceses =False (decay only). A follow up of 
                    the bug fix in 2.0.0
                RF: Replaced the Error#10 in the generation of the phase-space (for NLO) to a Warning#10.
                    In rare cases this error stopped the code, while this was not needed.
                RF: When using non-optimized loop output, the code now also works fine.
                OM: Modification of the code to allow the code to run on our servers
                VH: Improve the timing routine of the NLO code (displayed in debug mode)
                VH: FIX the import of old UFO model (those without the all_orders attribute).
                OM: Add a functionalities for restrict_model if a file paramcard_RESTRICTNAME.dat
                    exists, then this file is use as default param_card for that restriction.
                HS: Updated CutTools to v1.9.2

2.0.0(14/12/13)    CHANGE IN DEFAULT:
                   ------------------
                      OM: Change the Higgs mass to 125 GeV for most of the model (but the susy/v4 one).
                      OM: Change the default energy of collision to 13 TeV.
                      RF: Default renormalisation and factorisation scales are now set to H_T/2. (for aMC only)

                   MadEvent Update:
                   ----------------
                      OM+SF+RF: Add Frixione Photon isolation (also for aMC)
                      OM: Implementation of the reweight module for Leading Order matrix-element
                      JA+OM+AK: Store parameters needed for systematics studies.
                          This can be turned on with the use_syst parameter in
                          run_card.dat.
                          This output can be used to generate event weights for
                          a variety of variational parameters, including scalefact,
                          alpsfact, PDF choice, and matching scale. Note that this require
                          pythia-pgs v2.2 for matching scale.
                      OM+JA+Chia: Implement MadWidth (automatic/smart computation of the widths)
                      OM: Support for Form-Factor defined in the UFO model. and support for model
                          parameter presence inside the Lorentz expression.
                      OM: Support for a arbitrary functions.f file present inside the UFO model. 
                      JA: Included <clustering> tag in matched .lhe output, to be 
                          used together with Pythia 8 CKKW-L matching. This can be 
                          turned off with the clusinfo flag in run_card.dat.
                      JA: New treatment of matching for diagrams that have no
                          corresponding lower-multiplicity diagrams. Jets that
                          are not classified as shower-type emission jets are
                          flagged in the cluster scale info at the end of the event,
                          which is recognized by the Pythia interface in Pythia-PGS
                          package v. 2.2. For such jets, xqcut does not apply. This
                          allows for consistent matching e.g. of p p > w+ b b~ in 
                          the 4-flavor scheme. Note that auto_ptj_mjj must be set to
                          .false. for this to work properly.
                      OM: Change model restriction behavior: two widths with identical are not merged anymore.
                      S.Prestel(via OM): implement KT Durham cut. (thanks to Z. Marshall)
                      OM: Improved check for unresponsive of PBS cluster (thanks J. Mc Fayden)
                      OM: Implement a maximum number (2500) of jobs which can be submitted at the same time
                          by the PBS cluster. This number is currently not editable via configuration file.
                     
                   MadEvent Bug Fixing:
                   --------------------
                      OM: Fix a bug for h > l+ l- l+ l- (introduce in 1.5.9) where the phase-space parametrization 
                          fails to cover the full phase-space. This bugs occurs only if two identical particles decays
                          in identical particles and if both of those particles can't be on-shell simultaneously. 
                      OM: Fix a bug for multi_run sample in presence of negative weights (possible if NLO pdf)
                          The negative weights were not propagated to the merged sample. 
                          (thanks to Sebastien Brochet for the fix)
	         
                   aMC@NLO Update:       ! FIRST OFFICIAL RELEASE WITH NLO CAPABILITIES !
                   ---------------

                       RF: Using "virtual tricks" to reduce the number of PS points for which to include
                           the virtual corrections, leading to a speed up of the code.
                       OM+SF+RF: Add Frixione Photon isolation (also in MadEvent)
                       PA+OM: Fast version of MadSpin implemented (PS generation in Fortran).
		       OM: Allow to have MadSpin in "gridpack mode" (same cards/same decay). 
                           Add in the madspin_card "set ms_dir PATH". If the path didn't exist MS will
                           create the gridpack on that path, otherwise it will reuse the information 
                           (diagram generated, maximum weight of each channel, branching ratio,...)
                           This allow to bypass all the initialization steps BUT is valid only for the 
                           exact same event generation.
                       VH: Fixed set_run.f which incorrectly sets a default value for ptl, drll and
                           etal making the code insensitive to the values set in the run_card.dat 
                       VH: Fixed a bug in MadLoop that doubled the computing time for quad precision
                       VH+RF: Added MadLoop stability information to the log files (and run summary
                           in DEBUG mode).
                       RF: Fixed a stability problem in the reweighting to get PDF and scale uncertainties.
                       VH+RF: Improved the Binoth LHA interface
                       RF: Improved the multi-channeling for processes with more amplitudes than diagrams.
                       RF: Added a new parameter in the run_card to set the required accuracy for fixed 
                           order runs.

                           friendly way.
                       RF: Event normalization is now Les Houches compliant (the weights
		           of the events should average to the total rate). The old normalization
                           can still be chosen by setting the flag 'sum = event_norm' in the run_card.
		       RF: Fixes a bug related to the mass of the tau that was not consistently 
 		           taking into account in the phase-space set-up.
		       VH: Fixed the incorrect implementation of the four gluons R2 in the loop_sm UFO.
		       VH: Fixed the UV renormalization for the SM with massive c quarks.
                       RF: The PDF uncertainty for NNPDF is now also correctly given in the run summary
                       RF: Some improvements in the test_MC and test_ME when matrix elements are
                           numerically very large
                       OM+RF: Added the running at LO to the 'launch questions'
                       OM: Allow "check" command to use a event file.
                           This will use the related param_card and the first
                           event compatible with the requested process.
                       RF: Improved the phase-space generation in the case of competing resonances

                       VH: Fix computation in the Feynman gauge for the loops
                       RF: automatic computation of the NLO uncertainties
                       OM: NLO can now be runned with no central disk
                       MZ: change the format of number (using e and not d)
                       MZ: compilation and tests are possible in multicore
                       RF: allow to precise either uncertainty or number of events
                           for aMC@NLO/NLO
                       OM: ./bin/mg5 cmd.cmd is now working for NLO process

                    From beta1 (31/10/12):
                       aMCatNLO Team: First public (beta) version of aMCatNLO.

                  OM: Add a command print_results in the madevent interface. This command print the 
                      cross-section/number of events/... 
                  OM: change the way prompt color is handle (no systematic reset). Which provides better

                      the process directory)
                  OM: The question asking for the edition of the param_card/run_card
                      now accepts a command "set" to change values in those cards
                      without opening an editor. This allow simple implemetation

                  JA: Ensure identical results for identical seeds also with
                      multiple runs in the same directory. Note that identical runs
                      with previous versions can't be guaranteed (but different

                      This is done fully automatically for condor cluster.
                      For the other clusters, the user should set the variable

                      the directory is on the node filesystem). This still requires
                      access to central disk for copying, event combination,
                      running Pythia/PGS/Delphes etc.
                  OM: Replace fortran script combine_runs by a python script. 
                      This script allows to be more stable when running on clusters

                       file header.
                   JA: Stop run in presence of empty results.dat files 
                       (which can happen if there are problems with disk access
                       in a cluster run).

                       when the user press Ctrl-C during the job.

1.4.8 (24/07/12)  JA: Cancel running of integration channels where the BW
                      structure makes it impossible to get any events. This
                      can significantly speed up event generation for processes
                      with conflicting BWs.
                  JA: Minor modification of integration grid presetting in
                      myamp.f, due to the above point.
                  JA: Raise exception if a decay process has decaying particles
                      that are not present in the corresponding core process
                      (this might help avoid syntax mistakes).

                      when different process flags @N are given to different
                      decays of the same core process (sorry, this was missed
                      in v. 1.4.7).
                  JA: Fixed crash for process p p > w+ w+ j j t t~ when all 
                      w and t/t~ are decayed (bug #1017912, thanks to Nicolas

                  JA: Fixed crash for identical decay chains for particle-anti- 
                      particle when only one of the two is decayed, introduced 
                      in v. 1.4.7 (thanks John Lee).
                  OM: Ensure that matching plots are replaced correctly when
                      Pythia is run reusing a tag name.

                      generations in SLHA1<->2 converter (thanks Abhishek).

1.4.7 (25/06/12)  JA: Change the random seed treatment to ensure that the original 
                      seed is stored in the banner (this was broken in v. 1.4.0).
                      If a non-zero seed is given in the run_card, this seed
                      is used as starting value for the SubProcesses/randinit file,
                      while the seed in the run_card is set to 0.
                      This way, the seed for a multi_run is automatically
                      updated in the same way as for individual runs.

                      definitions are combined also when using the decay chain 
                      formalism (thanks to Zhen Liu for pointing this out).

                      non-identical matrix elements to be combined in certain
                      complicated processes (such as p p > l vl l vl l vl),
                      resulting in lines with Z > e+ mu- in the event file
                      (bug #1015032, thanks Johannes E for reporting).

                      unresponsive (should avoid some crashes on the web).
                  JA: Fixed support for color sextets in addmothers.f
                      (thanks Nicolas Deutschmann for reporting).          
                  JA: Make sure that also the SubProcesses directories are 
                      cleaned when running bin/compile in a gridpack.
                  JA: Removed the confusing makefile in Template and replace it
                      with scripts to create madevent.tar.gz and gridpack.tar.gz.
                  
1.4.6 (16/05/12)  JA: Added cuts on lepton pt for each of the 4 hardest leptons

                      works also in fermion flow- and color flow-violating

                      was set to a non automatic value in the card.)

                      configurations (needed for goldstino processes).
                  OM: Add a command to remove the file RunWeb which were not always
                      deleted correctly

                     in the html files.
                  OM: Changed the way the stdout/stderr are treated on the cluster

                      for both. (thanks abhishek)

                      p p > t t~ + jets with decays of t and t~.
                  JA: Added GE cluster to the list in cluster.py.
                  JA: Allow up to 1M events in a single run. Note that the 
                      unweighting (combine events) step gets quite slow with
                      so many events. Also note that if Pythia is run, still
                      maximum 50k events is recommended in a single run. 
                  OM: Fix problem linked to filesystem which makes new files

                      (introduced in v. 1.4.3).

1.4.3 (08/03/12)  JA: Reintroduced the possibility to completely forbid
                      s-channel diagrams, using the $$ notation. Note that
                      this should be used with great care, since the result
                      is in general not gauge-invariant. It is in general
                      better to use the $ notation, forbidding only onshell
                      s-channel particles (the inverse of decay chains).
                  JA: Automatically ensure that ptj and mmjj are below xqcut
                      when xqcut > 0, since ptj or mmjj > xqcut ruins matching.

                  OM: ALOHA modifications:
                       - Change sign convention for Epsilon (matching FR choices)
                       - For Fermion vertex forces that _1 always returns the  
                         incoming fermion and _2 returns the outcoming fermion. 
                         (This modifies conjugate routine output)
                       - Change the order of argument for conjugate routine
                         to expect IO order of fermion in all cases.
                       Note that the two last modifications matches MG5 conventions
                       and that those modifications correct bugs for interactions
                       a) subject to conjugate routine (i.e. if the model has 
                          majorana)                       
                       b) containing fermion momentum dependencies in the Lorentz
                          structure  
                       All model included by default in MG5 (in particular sm/mssm)
                       were not affected by those mismatch of conventions.

1.4.1 (06/02/12) OM: Fix the fermion flow check which was wrongly failing on 
                      some model  (Thanks to Benjamin)

                 OM: More secure html output (Thanks to Simon)

1.4.0 (04/02/12) OM: New user interface for the madevent run. Type:
                      1) (from madevent output) ./bin/madevent
                      2) (from MG5 command line) launch [MADEVENT_PATH] -i
                      This interface replaces various script like refine, 
                      survey, combine, run_..., rm_run, ...
                      The script generate_events still exists but now calls
                       ./bin/madevent. 
                 OM: For MSSM model, convert param_card to SLAH1. This card is
                      converted to SLAH2 during the MadEvent run since the UFO 
                      model uses SLAH2. This allows to use Pythia 6,
                      as well as having a coherent definition for the flavor.
                 JA+OM: For decay width computations, the launch command in 
                      addition to compute the width, creates a new param_card 
                      with the width set to the associated values, and with the 
                      Branching ratio associated (usefull for pythia). 
                 NOTE: This param_card makes sense for future run ONLY if all 
                      relevant decay are generated.
                 EXAMPLE: (after launch bin/mg5):
                       import model sm-full
                       generate t > b w+
                       define all = p b b~ l+ l- ta+ ta- vl vl~

                       launch
                 OM: change output pythia8 syntax: If a path is specified this 
                      is considered as the output directory.
                 OM: Change the path of the madevent output files. This allows 
                      to run pythia/pgs/delphes mulitple times for the same set 
                      of events (with different pythia/... parameters).
                 OM: Madevent output is now insensitive to the relative path
                      to pythia-pgs, delphes, ... In consequence you don't need
                      anymore to have your directory at the same level as 
                      Template directory. 
                 OM: MadEvent checks that the param_card is coherent with the 
                      restriction used during the model generation. 
                 OM: Model restrictions will now also force opposite number to 
                      match (helpfull for constraining to rotation matrix).  
                 OM: Change the import command. It's now allowed to omit the 
                      type of import. The type is guessed automaticaly. 
                      This is NOT allowed on the web.
                 OM: Add a check that the fermion flow is coherent with the 
                      Lorentz structure associates to the vertex.
                 OM: Add a check that the color representation is coherent.

                      be used, either via the configuration file or via the set 
                      command.
                 OM: Add the possibility to bypass the automatic opening of 
                      the web browser (via the configuration file: 
                      ./input/mg5_configuration.txt )
                 OM: add 'save options' command to save the current configuration 
                      in the configuration file. 
                 OM: Change the scheme of questions when running madevent and 
                      allow to specify in the command interface if you
                      want to run pythia/pgs/...

                      proc_card.dat.
                 OM: Add options for the display command:
                      a) display options: return the current option value. 
                        i.e. those set via the set command and/or via the 
                        configuration file
                      b) display variable NAME: return the current string 
                        representation of NAME and/or self.NAME .
                      c) display coupling_order: return the coupling orders with
                        their associated weight (for automatic order restriction)
                      d) display couplings now returns the list of all couplings
                        with the associated expression

                         in arguments 
                 OM: New Python script for the creation of the various html pages.
                      This Requires less disk access for the generation of the files.

                 OM: Improve cluster support. MadEvent now supports PBS/Condor/SGE
                      Thanks to Arian Abrahantes for the SGE implementation.
                 OM: Improve auto-completion (better output/dealing with multi line/...)
                 OM: Improve the parallel suite and change the release script to run
                      some of the parallel tests. This ensures even higher stability 
                      of the  code for the future releases.
                 JA: Changed the way gridpacks work: Set granularity to 1
                      (so randomly select channels only if they should generate 
                      less than 1 event), but allowing channels to run down to a single
                      iteration. This removes all old problems with increased
                      variance for small channels in the gridpacks, while giving 
                      even faster event generation.

                 Thanks to Johan Alwall, Sho Iwamoto for all the important 
                 testing/bug reports.


1.3.33 (01/01/12) JA: Revisited colors for propagators in addmothers.f
                      to ensure that propagators in color flow
                      violating processes get the correct color
                      from initial state particles (thanks to
                      Michele Gabusi for forcing me to do this).

1.3.32 (21/12/11) JA: Fixed a bug in the PDF reweighting routine,
                      which caused skewed eta distributions for

                      two different Majorana particles depends on the
                      incoming/outgoing status of the Majorana particles
                      (needed for MSSM with Goldstino).
                  JA: Fixed problem with colors in addmothers.f for complicated
                      multiparticle vertices and simplified color treatment

                  OM: Include some parallel test in the release script.


1.3.27 (05/11/11) JA: Fix bug in mirrored amplitudes (sometimes
                      amplitudes that should not be flagged as
                      mirrored were flagged as mirrored). Thanks
                      Marco Zaro for reporting this!
                  JA: Fix another problem getting enough events in
                      gridpack mode (it was not completely fixed in
                      v. 1.3.24). Thanks Alexis!
                  JA: Added "!" comments for all parameters in the default
                      run_card, since apparently this is still needed
                      for g77 to correctly read the parameters.
 
1.3.26 (31/10/11) JA: Fix color setting in MadEvent event file for
                      multiparticle vertices, which was not taken into
                      account in the upgrade in v. 1.3.18

1.3.25 (27/10/11) JA: Ensure that the correct intermediate resonance
                      is always written in the event file, even when we
                      have resonances with identical properties.
                  OM: Fix the bug forcing to quit the web browser in order to

                  OM: Change the tutorial in order to allow open index.html
                      after the output command. 

1.3.24 (22/10/11) JA: Fix problem with getting enough events in gridpack
                      mode (this was broken in v. 1.3.11 when we moved
                      from events to luminocity in refine). Thanks to
                      Alexis Kalogeropoulos.

1.3.23 (19/10/11) JA: Allow user to set scales using setscales.f again 
                      (this was broken in v. 1.3.18). Thanks to Arindam Das.
                  JA: Ensure that the error message is displayed if the
                     "make" command is not installed on the system.
 
1.3.22 (12/10/11) JA: Fixed another bug (also introduced in 1.3.18), which 
                      could give the wrong ordering between the s-channel 
                      propagators for certain multiprocess cases (this
                      also lead to a hard stop, so don't worry, if you get 
                      your events, the bug doesn't affect you). Sorry about
                      that, this is what happens when you add a lot of
                      new functionality...

1.3.21 (12/10/11) OM: Add a new command: install.
                      This allow to install quite easily different package
                      devellop for Madgraph/MadEvent. The list of available
                      package are pythia-pgs/MadAnalysis/ExRootAnalysis/Delphes

                      introduced in 1.3.18.

1.3.20 (09/10/11) JA: Fixed bug in myamp.f that created a hard stop
                      error for certain cases with many processes with
                      different propagators in the same subprocess dir.

1.3.19 (06/10/11) JA: Fixed problem with SubProcesses makefile on Linux,
                      introduced in 1.3.18.

1.3.18 (04/10/11) JA: Use model information to determine color of particles
                      for reweighting and propagator color info.
                  JA: Changed the definition of "forbidden s-channels"
                      denoted by "$" to exclude on-shell s-channels while
                      keeping all diagrams (i.e., complemetary to the decay
                      chain formalism). This reduces the problems with 
                      gauge invariance compared to previously.
                      "Onshell" is as usual defined by the "bwcutoff" flag 
                      in the run_card.dat.
                  JA: Enable proper 4-flavor matching (such as gg>hbb~+jets)
                      Note that you need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.9 or 
                      later to use with 4F matching.
                      Changes include: alpha_s reweighting also for b vertices,
                      new scale treatment (mu_F for pp>hbb~ is (pT_b^max*m_Th)),
                      no clustering of gluons to final-state massive particles
                      in MadEvent.
                  JA: Ensure that factorization scale settings and matching works
                      also in singlet t-channel exchange processes like
                      single top and VBF. The dynamic factorization
                      scale is given by the pT of the scattered quark
                      (on each side of the event).
                Note: You need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.10 or later
                      to use with VBF matching, to ensure that both radiated
                      and scattered partons are treated correctly
                      - scattered partons need to be excluded from the matching,
                      since their pT can be below QCUT. An even better
                      treatment would require to individually shower and match
                      the two sides in Pythia, which is not presently possible.
                Note: In the matched 4-flavor process p p > t b~ j $ w+ w- t~ +
                      p p > t b~ j j $ w+ w- t~, there is an admixture
                      of t-channel single top (with up to 1 radiated jet) 
                      and s-channel single top (with up to 2 radiated jets). 
                      In this case, the automatic determination of maximum 
                      multiplicity sample doesn't work (since max in the file 
                      will be 2 jets, but for t-channel max is 1 jet).
                      So MAXJETS=1 must be specified in the pythia_card.dat.
                  JA: Fixed pdf reweighting for matching, which due to a mistake
                      had never been activated.
                  JA: Improved phase space integration presetting further by 
                      taking into account special cuts like xpt, ht etc.
                  JA: Introduce new convention for invariant mass cuts
                      - if max < min, exclude intermediate range
                      (allows to exclude W/Z dijet resonances in VBF processes)

1.3.17 (30/09/11) OM: Fix a crash created by ALOHA when it tries to create the full
                      set of ALOHA routines (pythia8 output only).

1.3.14 (08/09/11) OM: Fix a bug in the RS model introduced in 1.3.8

1.3.13 (05/09/11) JA: Fixed bug with cut_decays=F which removed cuts also for
                      non-decay products in certain channels if there is
                      a forced decay present. Note that this does not affect
                      xqcut, only pt, minv and eta cuts.
                  JA: If non-zero phase space cutoff, don't use minimum of
                      1 GeV (this allows to go to e.g. 2m_e invariant mass for
                      \gamma* > e+ e-).

1.3.12 (01/09/11) JA: Fixed problem with decay chains when different decays
                      result in identical final states, such as
                      p p > go go, (go > b1/b1~ b/b~, b1/b1~ > b/b~ n1)
                      (only one of the decay chains was chosen, instead of
                      all 3 combinations (b1,b1), (b1,b1~), (b1~,b1~))
                  JA: Allow for overall orders also with grouped subprocesses
                  JA: Ensure that only leading color flows are included in event
                      output (so no singlet flows from color octets).
                  JA: Fixed small bug in fermion flow determination for multifermion
                      vertices.

1.3.11 (26/08/11) JA: Improved precision of "survey" by allowing 4th and 5th 
                      iteration if accuracy after 3 iterations < 10%.
                  JA: Subdivide BW in phase space integration for conflicting BWs 
                      also for forced decays, to improve generation with large
                      bwcutoff in e.g. W+ W- production with decays.
                  JA: Do refine using luminocity instead of number of events,
                      to work with badly determined channels.
                  JA: Don't use BW for shat if mass > sqrt(s).
                  JA: Fixed insertion of colors for octet resonances decaying to 
                      octet+singlet (thanks Bogdan for finding this)

                      coupling orders (order hierarchy and expansion_order).
                  JA: New "coupling order" specification WEIGHTED which checks
                      for  sum of coupling orders weighted by their hierarchy.

                      dynamic libraries on Mac OS X though, since it seems that 
                      common blocks might not work properly)

1.2.3 (11/05/11): JA: Fixed problem with scale choice in processes with mixed 
                      QED/QCD orders, e.g. p p > t t~ QED=2. Note that this fix
                      doesn't work for p p > t t~ j j QED=4 which should still
                      be avoided.
