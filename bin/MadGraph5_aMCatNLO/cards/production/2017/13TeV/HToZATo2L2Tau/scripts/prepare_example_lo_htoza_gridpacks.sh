# Notes:
# - This script was generated by prepare_MG5_cards.py
# - It should be run from the genproductions/bin/MadGraph5_aMCatNLO directory in a clean environment and will submit the gridpack generation for all points.
# - each gridpack generation should take about 20 minutes
# kEEP IN MIND : IF You are submitting from lxplus and the local directory is not on AFS 
# Automatically will switch to condor spool mode.
# So you have to call : ./submit_condor_gridpack_generation.sh 
# Now for the real gridpack production
