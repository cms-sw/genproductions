CMS Madgraph cards for W' to Tb and Bt samples.
The generation produces narrow-width W'->Tb/Bt samples in the 
T->Ht,Zt,Wb and B->Hb,Zb,Wt final states in nine W' mass points and various fractional T/B mass points as well as a few wider (15% width) points for comparison.

To generate the folders for each generator point, execute the script `./generateCards.py`. 
After this, everything is ready for gridpack generation.
