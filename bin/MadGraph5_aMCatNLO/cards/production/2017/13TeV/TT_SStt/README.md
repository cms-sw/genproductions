CMS Madgraph cards for TT to SStt, S to $\gamma \gamma$

Author: Dragana Pilipovic (dragana.nikola.pilipovic@cern.ch)

Cards for the pair production of vector like tops, each decaying to a new scalar S and a standard model top.  Adapted from https://github.com/cms-sw/genproductions/tree/master/bin/MadGraph5_aMCatNLO/cards/production/2017/13TeV/BulkGraviton_hh_tttt

Execute the script ./generateCards.py to generate the cards for the various mass points.  This is a 2d mass bump hunt for the vector like top and new scalar masses. The default setting is for T mass of 1000 GeV and S mass of 200 GeV. The mass points range from 50 to 350 GeV for S mass, in 50 GeV increments, and from 800 to 1500 GeV for T mass, in 100 GeV increments.
