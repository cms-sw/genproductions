## Cards for boosted spin-0 to bb
Note: at PR time, the cards only work with MG <= 2.6.0 and interactive gridpack production. Higher MG versions crash with a parsing error, which seems to indicate that the UFO needs to be reproduced with a newer syntax. The condor gridpack plugin appears to crash due to incorrect SubProcess directory naming.
