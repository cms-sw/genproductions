Datacards for a Top-philic Z' search, using as refernce model TopPhilicZp.zip, which has been validated for what concerns
* the xSec to be consistent with [ATLAS'quoted ones](https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2021-048/)
* the gen level kinematic plot
* the decay Br
* and that we can fully decay the top at dacards level (thus having the correct spin correlation of top decay particles)
