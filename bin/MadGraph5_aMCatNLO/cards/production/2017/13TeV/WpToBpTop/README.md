CMS Madgraph cards for W' to Bt samples (3+3 prong topology where the jet resonant masses can be different).
The generation produces narrow-width W'->Bt samples in the B->Zb final states.

To generate the folders for each generator point, execute the script `./generateCards.py`. 
After this, everything is ready for gridpack generation.
