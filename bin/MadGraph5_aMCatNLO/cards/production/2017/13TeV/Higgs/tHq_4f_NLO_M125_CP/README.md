# tHq samples to model dependence on top Yukawa CP structure at NLO

In order to model tHq production continuously in the plane of CP-even and CP-odd top Yukawa coupling modifiers, seven parameter configurations are selected here, which need to be interpolated in the analysis. 
The `writeCards.py` script prepares the cards based on the input cards provided in the `originalCards` directory.

## Functionality
- `writeCards.py` reads the original cards from the `originalCards` directory
- adjusts the `customizecards.dat` for each of the seven predefined parameter configurations
- separates hadronic and leptonic decay channels of the top quark
