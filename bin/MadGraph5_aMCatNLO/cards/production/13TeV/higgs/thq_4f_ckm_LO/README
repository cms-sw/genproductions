With these cards, you are able to generate the single top + Higgs process in the t-channel (four-flavour-scheme) at LO.

However, the gridpack_generation.sh scripts will not work, for we employ a reweighting technique to scan the 2dimensional plane spanned by the Yukawa coupling to the top and the coupling of the Higgs to vector bosons. Because of the latter, we need to use the Higgs characterization model, which allows to modify this coupling which in other models (e.g. the model sm) would be fixed. Have a look at the reweight_card! This reweighting is currently (as of Jun 03, 2015) not supported by the generation scripts.

Therefore we generated the LHEs by hand. Non-diagonal 3rd generation transitions are forbidden (see param_card.dat).
MG5 v2.2.3 was used.

Additionally, this process is best described with a special functional form of the scale. You can also find the corresponding setscales.f in the folder (also an arxiv reference is given there), to be put in the SubProcesses folder before launching the generation.

The bb, ww and tau tau channels need a leptonically decaying top. H->yy can live with inclusive top decay. (See lines 16-17 of https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Z3rgM7XZzUMBxZr3DUXMldvGipeHwjDolUW5GSKn_s/edit#gid=0)
