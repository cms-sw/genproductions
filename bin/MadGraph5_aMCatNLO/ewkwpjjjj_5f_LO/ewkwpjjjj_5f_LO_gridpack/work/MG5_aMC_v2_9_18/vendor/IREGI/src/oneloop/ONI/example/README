Set the correct compiler and paths in the makefile.

The example is set up to include LoopTools. If you do not have
LoopTools available, choose "WITHLT = no" in the makefile.

If you do want to use LoopTools, choose the right option for the
version you use: is version>=2.6 yes or no?

Then execute "make" followed by "./example.exe < input"
