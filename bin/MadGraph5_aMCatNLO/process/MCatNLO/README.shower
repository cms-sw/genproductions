All user-adjustable parameters related to the shower are stored in
Cards/shower_card.dat. On top of various pyhiscs settings, the user can
specify the analysis procedure to adopt. There are three main options.

1) StdHep/HepMC output (default).
StdHep/HepMC n-tuples are stored at the end of the run in the file
  Events/run_**/events**.hep.gz (StdHep)
or
  Events/run_**/events**.hepmc.gz (HepMC).
Herwig6 and Pythia6 will produce StdHep files, while Herwig++ and Pythia8 will
produce HepMC files.  These samples can be analysed afterwards with external
tools, like for example MadAnalysis5. This default option is used when
the ANALYSE variable is empty.
WARNING: the final files produced in this way are extremely large.
Please make sure to have enough disk space.

2) TopDrawer analyses.
The user can build her/his own analyses for TopDrawer output on the basis
of many examples in the MCatNLO/**Analyzer folders. Plots are stored at the
end of the run in the file Events/run_*/plot*.top.
To use one such analysis files (to be put in MCatNLO/**Analyzer) the user has
in principle to assign non-default values to the EXTRALIBS, EXTRAPATHS,
INCLUDEPATHS, ANALYSE variables.  For example, to shower p p > h HERWIG6
events with the ready-to-use mcatnlo_hwan_pp_h.f analysis, a typical setup is
  EXTRALIBS = stdc++ fastjet
  EXTRAPATHS = <path-to-fastjet>/lib
  INCLUDEPATHS = <path-to-fastjet>/include 
  ANALYSE = mcatnlo_hwan_pp_h.o mcatnlo_hbook_gfortran8.o myfastjetfortran.o
If the user has Fastjet in her/his own PATH, it is not necessary to fill
the EXTRAPATHS and INCLUDEPATHS variables. The use of FastJet, and of file
myfastjetfortran.f is required only if in the analysis there is a call to function
fastjetppgenkt.
Results from the various runs can be combined by means of the dedicated scripts
in the Utilities folder.

3) HwU analyses.
Same as for item 2) for HwU output. HwU is an internal plotting package that
allows flexibility in the output and in the combination of plots. The user can
write an own analysis on the basis of the many examples in the MCatNLO/**Analyzer
folders.
Output files are stored in Events/run_*, and results from the various runs can
be combined by means of the python script in bin/internal/histograms.py.

4) User's own analyses.
The user has to assign non-default values to the EXTRALIBS, EXTRAPATHS,
INCLUDEPATHS, ANALYSE environmental variables.  Analysis files have to be put
in MCatNLO/**Analyzer.
