This is an example of the use of OneLOop in C++ with the gcc compilers.
The file "example.cpp" includes the file "cavh_olo.h" in this directory
establishing the interface. All available routines are listed as "#define"
statements at the beginning of that file.

Execute

./create.py

This will create the library "libavh_olo.a". Then execute

g++ example.cpp -L./ -lavh_olo -lgfortran

This will create the executable.

Alternatively, you can execute

./create.py source

This will only create the source file "avh_olo.f90". Then you can
execute

g++ -c example.cpp
gfortran -c avh_olo.f90
g++ example.o avh_olo.o -lgfortran

to create the executable.
