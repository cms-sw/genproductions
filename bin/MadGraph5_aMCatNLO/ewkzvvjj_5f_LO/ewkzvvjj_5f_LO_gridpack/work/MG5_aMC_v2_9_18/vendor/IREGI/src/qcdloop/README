This directory contains three subdirectories
        ff  -- the ff library 
	ql  -- the ql library 
	Doc -- contains the documentation file 


Typing make should compile the ff library, the ql library and the test
program test.f. Executing ./test one should then reproduce the output
in test.out.

The directory ff is taken from http://www.xs4all.nl/~gjvo/FF.html. The
file ffinit_mine.f replaces the original file ff_init.f. One has to
adjust here the path (twice) and set it to the location of the the ff
library. The makefile in ff has been modified accordingly.

For any problems or bug reports send an email to ellis@fnal.gov and
g.zanderighi1@physics.ox.ac.uk.
