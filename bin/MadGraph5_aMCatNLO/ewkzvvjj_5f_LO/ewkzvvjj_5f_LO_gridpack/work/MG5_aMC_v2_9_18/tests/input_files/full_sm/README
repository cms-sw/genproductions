This is the template directory for MadGraph/MadEvent v4
models created with the FeynRules Mathematica package.

To use it, follow FeynRules instructions to create a
MG output of your model (set of various text files), move these
files in this directory and type 

make testprog
./testprog

in order to verify that your model compiles properly.

Once it is done, move this directory to the "Models" directory
of your MadGraph/MadEvent installation. You can then use it by
modifying the model parameter in your proc_card.dat.

The "make helas_couplings" compilation mode produces an indepedent
piece of code (./helas_couplings) generating a text file (helas_couplings.txt)
with all the coupling values required by external packages like BRIDGE.
