two steps for obtaining the final plots (currently these scripts are suitable for WJets and DY)

step1: generating all the histograms (on lxplus)

modify the "inDIR" in histo.sh to the directory storing your rootfiles after crab, and then run "sh histo.sh -q SUBMIT". After the job finish, you will get rootfile contining the histograms under the path where you do the submission

N.B.:
* you should do this outside of eos directory
* for the low mass DY, you may need to change the mass range of histogram "h_Zmass_GEN" in histo.py

step2: yield the plots

this step has two modes, one-to-one comparison between two versions, and inclusive v.s summed-up exclusive of one version.

1) the first case: modify the xs/histo_name/name correspondingly, and run "sh plot.sh -m TWOVERSION"

2) the second case: modify the xs/histo_name/name correspondingly, and run "sh plot.sh -m INCVSSTIT"

for the XS, you can use genproductions/Utilities/calculateXSectionAndFilterEfficiency/nanoXS.sh
