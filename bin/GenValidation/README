### preparing validation setup including gridpack generation using the example of MG5_aMC@NLO 
# create your working path
mkdir -p SOMENAME; cd SOMENAME; WORKDIR=`pwd`
cd ${WORKDIR}
git clone https://github.com/cms-sw/genproductions.git genproductions

### make gridpacks e.g. at lxplus, more info can be found at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/QuickGuideMadGraph5aMCatNLO  
cd ${WORKDIR}/genproductions/bin/MadGraph5_aMCatNLO
cp -rp ${WORKDIR}/genproductions/bin/GenValidation/validation_cards . 
./gridpack_generation.sh PROCESS validation_cards/MG5_aMC@NLO/PROCESS

### run validation tools 
cd ${WORKDIR}
cp ${WORKDIR}/genproductions/bin/GenValidation/submit_validation.sh .
# copy final gridpacks for the two versions you want to compare to some path
# include the path and gridpack name in submit_validation.sh
# adjust settings according to your needs, e.g. specify batch system,... 
# run submission once per gridpack 
source submit_validation.sh 
# wait for jobs to finish 

### do final comparison 
cp ${WORKDIR}/genproductions/bin/GenValidation/merge_mkhtml.sh .
# adjust name of the tags you want to compare and run 
source merge_mkhtml.sh
